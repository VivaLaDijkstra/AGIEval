Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $\\frac{x-1}{3}=k$ and $k=3$, what is the value of $x ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)2 (B)4 (C)9 (D)10\n", "line_idx": 0}

If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    For $i=\\sqrt{-1}$, what is the sum $(7+3 i)+(-8+9 i) ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$-1+12 i$ (B)$-1-6 i$ (C)$15+12 i$ (D)$15-6 i$ 3\n", "line_idx": 1}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    On Saturday afternoon, Armand sent $m$ text messages each hour for 5 hours, and Tyrone sent $p$ text messages each hour for 4 hours. Which of the following represents the total number of messages sent by Armand and Tyrone on Saturday afternoon?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$9 m p$ (B)$20 m p$ (C)$5 m+4 p$ (D)$4 m+5 p$\n", "line_idx": 2}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Kathy is a repair technician for a phone company. Each week, she receives a batch of phones that need repairs. The number of phones that she has left to fix at the end of each day can be estimated with the equation $P=108-23 d$, where $P$ is the number of phones left and $d$ is the number of days she has worked that week. What is the meaning of the value 108 in this equation?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)Kathy will complete the repairs within 108 days. (B)Kathy starts each week with 108 phones to fix. (C)Kathy repairs phones at a rate of 108 per hour. (D)Kathy repairs phones at a rate of 108 per day.\n", "line_idx": 3}

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$4 x^{2} y^{2}$ (B)$8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$ (C)$2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$ (D)$2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$\n", "line_idx": 4}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$h=3 a+28.6$$A pediatrician uses the model above to estimate the height $h$ of a boy, in inches, in terms of the boy's age $a$, in years, between the ages of 2 and 5.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$m=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1} P$$The formula above gives the monthly payment $m$ needed to pay off a loan of $P$ dollars at $r$ percent annual interest over $N$ months. Which of the following gives $P$ in terms of $m, r$, and $N$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$P=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1} m$ (B)$P=\\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1}{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}} m$ (C)$P=\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right) m$ (D)$P=\\left(\\frac{1,200}{r}\\right) m$\n", "line_idx": 6}

If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $\\frac{a}{b}=2$, what is the value of $\\frac{4 b}{a} ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0 (B)1 (C)2 (D)4\n", "line_idx": 7}

is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\\\2 y-x=-19\\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(-5,-2)$ (B)$(3,-8)$ (C)$(4,-6)$ (D)$(9,-6)$\n", "line_idx": 8}

Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)8 (B)0 (C)-1 (D)-8\n", "line_idx": 9}

of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\\\& c=1.75+0.40 x\\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(0,7)$ (B)$(1,7)$ (C)$(7,7)$ (D)$(14,2)$\n", "line_idx": 11}

2216}, "metadata": 12, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $x>3$, which of the following is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}}$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{2 x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$ (B)$\\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$ (C)$2 x+5$ (D)$x^{2}+5 x+6$\n", "line_idx": 12}

157, "total_tokens": 2136}, "metadata": 13, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $3 x-y=12$, what is the value of $\\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$2^{12}$ (B)4 (C)$8^{2}$ (D)The value cannot be determined from the information given.\n", "line_idx": 13}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation must be equal. Comparing the coefficients of the $x^{2}$ terms yields $ab=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $a b=15 \\Rightarrow a(8-a)=15 \\Rightarrow 8 a-a^{2}=15 \\Rightarrow a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Solving this equation for $a$ yields $a=5$ or $a=3$. Since $b=8-a$, it follows that $b=3$ or $b=5$, respectively. Substituting $a$ and $b$ into the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ yields $c=10$ or $c=21$, respectively.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect because these choices do not satisfy the

"completion_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 2275}, "metadata": 14, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)3 and 5 (B)6 and 35 (C)10 and 21 (D)31 and 41\n", "line_idx": 14}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $y=k x$, where $k$ is a constant, and $y=24$ when $x=6$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=5$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)6 (B)15 (C)20 (D)23\n", "line_idx": 15}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $16+4 x$ is 10 more than 14 , what is the value of $8 x$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)2 (B)6 (C)16 (D)80 5\n", "line_idx": 16}

the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}1 \\text { decagram } & =10 \\text { grams } \\\\1,000 \\text { milligrams } & =1 \\text { gram }\\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\quad 0.002$ (B)$\\quad 200$ (C)$\\quad 2,000$ (D)20,000\n", "line_idx": 17}

Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    For what value of $n$ is $|n-1|+1$ equal to 0 ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0 (B)1 (C)2 (D)There is no such value of $n$.\n", "line_idx": 18}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers.

( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\\left({ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\right)$. At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$-46^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ (B)$-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ (C)$-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ (D)$-50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n", "line_idx": 20}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following numbers is NOT a solution of the inequality $3 x-5 \\geq 4 x-3$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-1 (B)-2 (C)-3 (D)-5\n", "line_idx": 21}

If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\\cline { 3 - 5 }\\multicolumn{2}{c|}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{Course} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\\\\\cline { 2 - 5 }\\multicolumn{2}{c|}{} & Algebra I & Geometry & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Algebra } \\\\ \\text { II }\\end{array}$ & \\multirow{2}{*}{Total} \\\\\\hline\\multirow{2}{*}{Gender} & Female & 35 & 53 & 62 &  \\\\\\cline { 2 - 5 }& Male & 44 & 59 & 57 & 160 \\\\\\hline& Total & 79 & 112 & 119 & 310 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}A group of tenth-grade students responded to a survey that asked which math course they were currently enrolled in.

Therefore, if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data, the mean will change the most because it is affected by the outlier the most.

"context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\\hline\\multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Lengths of Fish (in inches)} \\\\\\hline8 & 9 & 9 & 9 & 10 & 10 & 11 \\\\\\hline11 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 13 & 13 \\\\\\hline13 & 14 & 14 & 15 & 15 & 16 & 24 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The table above lists the lengths, to the nearest inch, of a random sample of 21 brown bullhead fish.

( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\\\& y>x+b\\end{aligned}$$In the $x y$-plane, if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities above, which of the following relationships between $a$ and $b$ must be true?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$a>b$ (B)$b>a$ (C)$|a|>|b|$ (D)$a=-b$\n", "line_idx": 24}

circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A food truck sells salads for $\\$ 6.50$ each and drinks for $\\$ 2.00$ each. The food truck's revenue from selling a total of 209 salads and drinks in one day was $\\$ 836.50$.

"context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$0.88 p$ (B)$\\frac{p}{0.88}$ (C)$(0.8)(1.08) p$ (D)$\\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$\n", "line_idx": 26}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is the ratio of the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream to the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams. This sum is $11+68=79$. The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X who recalled 1 to 4 dreams, the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams, and the number of people in Group X and Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams. This sum is $28+11+57+68=164$. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\\frac{79}{164}$.Choices $A$ and $B$ are incorrect because these choices are the ratios of the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream to the total number of people in Group Y and Group X, respectively.

answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)3.5 (B)4.0 (C)4.5 (D)5.0\n", "line_idx": 29}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Katarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did. Based on Katarina's observation, if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, how many pears did the Type B trees produce?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)115 (B)120 (C)124 (D)173\n", "line_idx": 30}

"usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2229, "completion_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 2421}, "metadata": 31, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A square field measures 10 meters by 10 meters. Ten students each mark off a randomly selected region of the field; each region is square and has side lengths of 1 meter, and no two regions overlap. The students count the earthworms contained in the soil to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in each region.

Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    For a polynomial $p(x)$, the value of $p(3)$ is -2 .Which of the following must be true about $p(x)$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$x-5$ is a factor of $p(x)$. (B)$x-2$ is a factor of $p(x)$. (C)$x+2$ is a factor of $p(x)$. (D)The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2 .\n", "line_idx": 32}

"total_tokens": 2156}, "metadata": 33, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$2 z+1=z$$What value of $z$ satisfies the equation above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-2 (B)-1 (C)$\\frac{1}{2}$ (D)1\n", "line_idx": 33}

the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A television with a price of $\\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$300=30 w-60$ (B)$300=30 w$ (C)$300=30 w+60$ (D)$300=60 w-30$\n", "line_idx": 34}

exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Shipping Charges\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\\hline$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Merchandise weight } \\\\ \\text { (pounds) }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Shipping } \\\\ \\text { charge }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hline5 & $\\$ 16.94$ \\\\\\hline10 & $\\$ 21.89$ \\\\\\hline20 & $\\$ 31.79$ \\\\\\hline40 & $\\$ 51.59$ \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\sqrt{9 x^{2}}$$If $x>0$, which of the following is equivalent to the given expression?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$3 x$ (B)$3 x^{2}$ (C)$18 x$ (D)$18 x^{4}$\n", "line_idx": 36}

Since the product of two real numbers is 0 if and only if one of the numbers is 0 , it follows that $x=-3$ or $x=1$.Choices $A$ and $B$ are incorrect because these values of $x$ do not satisfy the equation.

$x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-3 (B)0 (C)1 (D)-3 and -1\n", "line_idx": 37}

( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A circle in the $x y$-plane has center $(5,7)$ and radius 2. Which of the following is an equation of the circle?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=4$ (B)$(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=4$ (C)$(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$ (D)$(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=2$\n", "line_idx": 38}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis.

  $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9\nChoose from the following options:    (A)I only (B)II only (C)I and II (D)Neither I nor II\n", "line_idx": 40}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{A}$ is correct. To determine whether the system has a solution, the equations must be solved for $x$ and $y$.

Substituting this expression for $y$ into the second equation yields $a x+2 \\left(\\frac{4 x+2}{3}\\right)=4$, or $3 a x+4=12$. Solving this equation for $x$ yields $x=\\frac{12-4}{3 a}$. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the expression for $y$ yields $y=\\frac{4 \\left(\\frac{12-4}{3 a}\\right)+2}{3}$.

answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \\\\& a x+2 y=4\\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $a$ is a constant. For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-6 (B)-3 (C)3 (D)6\n", "line_idx": 41}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice B is correct. The helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude is given by the equation $y=40+21 t$. This equation states that the altitude increases by 21 feet for every second that passes.Choice $A$ is incorrect because this equation does not take into account the time $t$. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the helicopter is gaining altitude, not decreasing it.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A helicopter, initially hovering 40 feet above the ground, begins to gain altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. Which of the following functions represents the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$y=40+21$ (B)$y=40+21 t$ (C)$y=40-21 t$ (D)$y=40 t+21$\n", "line_idx": 42}

This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long.

Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following is equivalent to $2 x\\left(x^{2}-3 x\\right)$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$-4 x^{2}$ (B)$3 x^{3}-x^{2}$ (C)$2 x^{3}-3 x$ (D)$2 x^{3}-6 x^{2}$\n", "line_idx": 45}

$x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A retail company has 50 large stores located in different areas throughout a state. A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store (B)Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected (C)Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees (D)Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses\n", "line_idx": 46}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$h(x)=2^{x}$$The function $h$ is defined above.

"completion_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 2364}, "metadata": 48, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A researcher surveyed a random sample of students from a large university about how often they see movies. Using the sample data, the researcher estimated that $23 \\%$ of the students in the population saw a movie at least once per month. The margin of error for this estimation is $4 \\%$. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about all students at the university, based on the given estimate and margin of error?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)It is unlikely that less than $23 \\%$ of the students see a movie at least once per month. (B)At least 23\\%, but no more than $25 \\%$, of the students see a movie at least once per month. (C)The researcher is between $19 \\%$ and $27 \\%$ sure that most students see a movie at least once per month. (D)It is plausible that the percentage of students who see a movie at least once per month is between $19 \\%$ and $27 \\%$.\n", "line_idx": 48}

the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\\hlineList A & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\\hlineList B & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The table above shows two lists of numbers. Which of the following is a true statement comparing list $\\mathrm{A}$ and list B ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The means are the same, and the standard deviations are different. (B)The means are the same, and the standard deviations are the same. (C)The means are different, and the standard deviations are different. (D)The means are different, and the standard deviations are the same.\n", "line_idx": 49}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A book was on sale for $40 \\%$ off its original price. If the sale price of the book was $\\$ 18.00$, what was the original price of the book?

"context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A right circular cone has a volume of $24 \\pi$ cubic inches. If the height of the cone is 2 inches, what is the radius, in inches, of the base of the cone?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$2 \\sqrt{3}$ (B)6 (C)12 (D)36\n", "line_idx": 51}

{"prompt_tokens": 2030, "completion_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 2303}, "metadata": 52, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In 2015 the populations of City $\\mathrm{X}$ and City $\\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \\%$ and the population of City $\\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \\%$. If the population of City $\\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)60,000 (B)90,000 (C)160,000 (D)240,000\n", "line_idx": 52}

2250}, "metadata": 53, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V=\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Which of the following gives the radius of the sphere in terms of the volume of the sphere?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{4 \\pi}{3 V}$ (B)$\\frac{3 V}{4 \\pi}$ (C)$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{4 \\pi}{3 V}}$ (D)$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3 V}{4 \\pi}}$\n", "line_idx": 53}

the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

The vertex of the parabola is the point at which the parabola changes direction, and the coordinates of the vertex can be found by solving the equation for $x$ and setting the derivative of the equation equal to 0. Solving the equation for $x$ yields $x=3$, and setting the derivative equal to 0 yields $2(x-3)=0$, which implies that $x=3$. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is $(3, a)$.

If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following is true about the parabola?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$. (B)Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$. (C)Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$. (D)Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.\n", "line_idx": 55}

Solving for $x$ yields $x=50$.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when solving the equation for $x$.\nThe answer is therefore C", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem", " 6", ":", "  ", " Choice", " $\\", "math", "bf", "{", "C", "}", "$", " is", " correct", ".", " Let", " $", "x", "$", " and", " $", "y", "$", " represent", " the", " number", " of", " mill", "ilit", "ers", " of", " the", " $", "10", " \\", "%", "$", " and", " $", "20", " \\", "%", "$", " by", " mass", " saline", " solutions", ",", " respectively", ".", " Since", " Clayton", " will", " use", " 100", " mill", "ilit", "ers", " of", " the", " $", "20", " \\", "%", "$", " by", " mass", " saline", " solution", ",", " $", "y", "=", "100", "$.", " Subst", "it", "uting", " this", " value", " into", " the", " given", " equation", " yields", " $", "0", ".", "10", " x", "+", "0", ".", "20", "(", "100", ")=", "0", ".", "18", "(", "x", "+", "100", ")", "$.", " Sol", "ving", " for", " $", "x", "$", " yields", " $", "x", "=", "50", "$.", "Cho", "ices", " $", "A", ",", " B", "$,", " and", " $", "D", "$", " are", " incorrect", " and", " may", " result", " from", " errors", " made", " when", " solving", " the", " equation", " for", " $", "x", "$.", "\n", "The", " answer", " is", " therefore", " C", "<|endoftext|>", " §§", " FILE", " READ"], "token_logprobs": [-1.1398727e-05, -0.0018963452, -2.0575926e-05, -3.941184e-05, -0.00029581378, -0.00029068594, -0.00033224377, -0.0010538982, -0.034977887, -0.0025372067, -1.0282103, -0.0015713546, -0.08569164, -0.0007270957, -0.35669744, -0.0002454927, -0.00054590043, -0.00031978224, -0.00020465575, -0.0006711474, -1.4226358, -0.32629758, -0.05952917, -0.0050526513, -0.9820037, -0.00086256367, -0.00046861471, -0.002030422, -0.31899914, -0.07473484, -0.45526817, -0.000867576, -0.00065564, -0.0007396201, -0.0009814043, -0.058511566, -0.09647339, -0.17471567, -0.0015182232, -0.056506988, -0.0037459156, -0.0018650545, -0.31568697, -0.02202176, -0.00081919605, -0.0055577955, -0.00087467505, -0.007432156, -0.7077609, -0.00087491254, -0.13021511, -0.14414133, -0.058825698, -0.0011101093, -0.44568232, -0.71554416, -0.18979402, -0.7076004, -0.12820412, -0.08855818, -0.003320503, -0.00023524073, -2.4510746e-05, -0.00037922888, -0.0030608699, -0.0055869846, -0.00019201681, -0.007878166, -0.0010029455, -0.0014827629, -0.02290096, -0.00046181606, -0.22214863, -0.003062305, -0.016502045, -0.886949, -0.0017586462, -0.24132223, -0.002623201, -0.08611285, -0.19056626, -0.008399216, -8.8171946e-05, -0.7092998, -0.21077888, -0.45728728, -0.0009388675, -0.6261132, -0.0005266365, -0.098439895, -0.8190221, -0.0051895487, -0.0006244458, -0.21598361, -0.0500926, -0.006160344, -0.576096, -7.648668e-05, -0.0109006455, -0.65469354, -0.0007667621, -0.0041461913, -0.0032442566, -0.00022421066, -0.0008075043, -0.08355999, -0.009823631, -0.0003639655, -0.0019305066, -0.061699163, -0.32812047, -0.6729053, -0.00037934902, -0.7526302, -0.00512071, -0.00016340296, -0.11983459, -0.17678523, -0.033502176, -0.020668106, -0.0025411518, -0.07166097, -0.16606165, -0.9002914, -1.1514188e-05, -0.06345863, -0.0007631849, -0.28716072, -0.009538719, -0.0871434, -0.0005611666, -0.031013535, -0.00061764714, -0.000249787, -0.00197201, -0.0021548383, -0.26697683, -0.021423103, -0.021731218, -0.0005156646, -0.47807738, -0.25567344, -0.20912851, -0.15590215, -0.18657808, -0.13806589, -0.8772059, -0.0032916209, -9.329886e-05, -0.20710249, -0.063699365, -0.0010915541, -0.00016531031, -0.00010772499, -0.0017114134, -0.0004944342, -0.009527165, -0.017528221, -0.00068456633, -1.2838377], "top_logprobs": null, "text_offset": [6525, 6525, 6527, 6531, 6536, 6540, 6548, 6550, 6551, 6553, 6560, 6563, 6567, 6569, 6570, 6571, 6572, 6573, 6576, 6584, 6585, 6589, 6591, 6592, 6593, 6597, 6599, 6600, 6601, 6611, 6615, 6622, 6625, 6630, 6634, 6637, 6640, 6644, 6646, 6648, 6650, 6651, 6652, 6656, 6658, 6660, 6662, 6663, 6664, 6667, 6672, 6679, 6689, 6690, 6703, 6704, 6710, 6718, 6723, 6727, 6731, 6736, 6740, 6743, 6746, 6750, 6752, 6754, 6756, 6757, 6758, 6761, 6766, 6773, 6782, 6783, 6785, 6786, 6787, 6790, 6792, 6798, 6800, 6805, 6810, 6816, 6821, 6825, 6831, 6840, 6847, 6849, 6850, 6851, 6853, 6855, 6856, 6857, 6858, 6860, 6861, 6864, 6866, 6867, 6868, 6870, 6871, 6872, 6873, 6876, 6877, 6879, 6883, 6887, 6891, 6893, 6894, 6895, 6902, 6904, 6905, 6906, 6908, 6910, 6913, 6917, 6919, 6920, 6921, 6923, 6925, 6929, 6931, 6932, 6933, 6937, 6947, 6951, 6955, 6962, 6967, 6974, 6979, 6984, 6992, 6996, 7005, 7009, 7011, 7012, 7014, 7015, 7018, 7025, 7028, 7038, 7040, 7040, 7040, 7040]}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2053, "completion_tokens": 156, "total_tokens": 2209}, "metadata": 57, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \\%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution must he use?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)5 (B)25 (C)50 (D)100\n", "line_idx": 57}

The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function because the number of people invited each year is double the number of people invited the previous year. This is an example of exponential growth.Choices $A$ and $B$ are incorrect because the function $f$ is not linear.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The first year Eleanor organized a fund-raising event, she invited 30 people. For each of the next 5 years, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. If $f(n)$ is the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event, which of the following statements best describes the function $f$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function. (B)The function $f$ is an increasing linear function. (C)The function $f$ is a decreasing exponential function. (D)The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.\n", "line_idx": 58}

The given table shows that the values of $y$ increase by $-a$ when the values of $x$ increase by 3 and by $-2 a$ when the values of $x$ increase by 5. This implies that the slope of the line is $\\frac{-2 a}{5}=\\frac{-a}{2.5}$. Since the slope of the line is $\\frac{-a}{2.5}$, the equation of the line can be written as $y=\\frac{-a}{2.5} x+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since the table shows that when $x=0$, $y=0$, it follows that $b=0$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $2 x-y=-5 a$.Choices $A$ and $B$ are incorrect because these equations do not represent the given linear relationship.

"metadata": 59, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\\\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$x+2 y=a$ (B)$x+2 y=5 a$ (C)$2 x-y=-5 a$ (D)$2 x-y=7 a$\n", "line_idx": 59}

"stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2021, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 2278}, "metadata": 60, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\\\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-0.5 (B)-0.25 (C)0.8 (D)1.75\n", "line_idx": 60}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. Since the number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1 \\%$ each year, the number of grains $t$ years after the first year can be modeled by the function $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$.Choice $A$ is incorrect because this function does not account for the annual increase in the number of grains. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the exponent should be $t$, not $1.01 t$. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the base should be $1.01$, not $0.99$.\nThe answer is therefore D", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem", " 6", ":", "  ", " Choice", " $\\", "math", "bf", "{", "D", "}", "$", " is", " correct", ".", " Since", " the", " number", " of", " pollen", " grains", " per", " square", " cent", "imeter", " increases", " by", " $", "1", " \\", "%", "$", " each", " year", ",", " the", " number", " of", " grains", " $", "t", "$", " years", " after", " the", " first", " year", " can", " be", " modeled", " by", " the", " function", " $", "P", "(", "t", ")=", "310", "(", "1", ".", "01", ")", "^{", "t", "}", "$.", "Choice", " $", "A", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " this", " function", " does", " not", " account", " for", " the", " annual", " increase", " in", " the", " number", " of", " grains", ".", " Choice", " $", "B", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " exponent", " should", " be", " $", "t", "$,", " not", " $", "1", ".", "01", " t", "$.", " Choice", " $", "C", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " base", " should", " be", " $", "1", ".", "01", "$,", " not", " $", "0", ".", "99", "$.", "\n", "The", " answer", " is", " therefore", " D", "<|endoftext|>", " §§", " FILE", " READ", "ME", ".", "md", "\n"], "token_logprobs": [-2.1051823e-05, -0.00228913, -2.5344274e-05, -1.9765537e-06, -0.00028424585, -0.00045704586, -0.00031715777, -0.0007765466, -0.036732588, -0.0013264992, -0.40075588, -0.001644667, -0.114434, -0.00053576205, -0.00055341335, -0.00020620546, -0.00027745095, -0.00026648093, -0.00032896505, -0.0007860908, -1.1065559, -0.4293754, -0.08999382, -0.0009589143, -0.13774145, -0.00051375636, -0.13901936, -0.0017642585, -0.0015222819, -0.00030535142, -0.44068006, -0.26498052, -0.54267377, -0.0008992545, -0.14265774, -0.0030505287, -0.010830993, -0.50364065, -0.00029736536, -0.036420368, -0.37923083, -0.2035305, -0.0987713, -0.6843417, -0.95238703, -0.17214969, -0.0009920279, -0.0013370637, -0.008678516, -0.0036335648, -0.03892098, -0.012130067, -0.79693985, -0.0005457812, -0.39108127, -0.20507126, -0.5674554, -0.98858577, -0.029644856, -0.005787741, -0.011937203, -0.00038960468, -0.009281862, -0.03742823, -0.06816069, -0.00035382994, -0.0051344885, -0.00020501523, -0.0030401857, -0.002873215, -0.00038495276, -0.060693283, -0.16244893, -0.74061245, -0.1041764, -0.0012169267, -0.00028198276, -0.0011272951, -0.0007223837, -0.5597552, -1.0632217, -0.49689817, -0.5235095, -0.00011487751, -1.0747148, -0.00016888563, -0.07755797, -0.7815636, -0.35234547, -0.31535012, -0.053028807, -0.009367714, -0.00053480745, -0.6660067, -0.25406575, -0.5433795, -0.11262217, -0.05889278, -0.00024608686, -0.0024849821, -0.0014622909, -0.250196, -0.9634709, -1.4756811, -0.88248223, -0.09439956, -0.5039146, -0.38354325, -0.40663043, -0.02732671, -0.02938272, -0.0026685023, -0.0038196887, -0.002681889, -0.326354, -0.056622222, -0.1248074, -0.15105666, -0.0003557382, -0.00028901699, -0.0008431185, -0.0014101799, -0.023066608, -0.27366585, -1.0987397, -0.27366093, -0.007523135, -0.49565282, -0.0005062424, -0.0011239534, -0.00042484637, -0.060605183, -0.00893245, -0.09364895, -0.008707733, -0.00025181074, -0.0009541412, -0.016395586, -0.030096903, -0.0008769419, -8.447461e-05, -8.459475e-05, -0.0011333813, -0.00043784294, -0.014492808, -0.01615598, -0.0006252821, -1.2776756, -0.00017914227, -0.0004500097, -3.7505437e-05, -0.0011286073], "top_logprobs": null, "text_offset": [6753, 6753, 6755, 6759, 6764, 6768, 6776, 6778, 6779, 6781, 6788, 6791, 6795, 6797, 6798, 6799, 6800, 6801, 6804, 6812, 6813, 6819, 6823, 6830, 6833, 6840, 6847, 6851, 6858, 6863, 6869, 6879, 6882, 6884, 6885, 6887, 6888, 6889, 6894, 6899, 6900, 6904, 6911, 6914, 6921, 6923, 6924, 6925, 6931, 6937, 6941, 6947, 6952, 6956, 6959, 6967, 6970, 6974, 6983, 6985, 6986, 6987, 6988, 6990, 6993, 6994, 6995, 6996, 6998, 6999, 7001, 7002, 7003, 7005, 7011, 7013, 7014, 7015, 7018, 7028, 7036, 7041, 7050, 7055, 7059, 7067, 7071, 7075, 7082, 7091, 7094, 7098, 7105, 7108, 7115, 7116, 7123, 7125, 7126, 7127, 7130, 7140, 7148, 7152, 7161, 7168, 7171, 7173, 7174, 7176, 7180, 7182, 7183, 7184, 7186, 7188, 7190, 7197, 7199, 7200, 7201, 7204, 7214, 7222, 7226, 7231, 7238, 7241, 7243, 7244, 7245, 7247, 7249, 7253, 7255, 7256, 7257, 7259, 7261, 7262, 7265, 7272, 7275, 7285, 7287, 7287, 7287, 7287, 7287, 7287, 7287, 7287]}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2093, "completion_tokens": 144, "total_tokens": 2237}, "metadata": 61, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Keith modeled the growth over several hundred years of a tree population by estimating the number of the trees' pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. He estimated there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter the first year the grains were deposited, with a $1 \\%$ annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of the following functions models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$P(t)=310^{t}$ (B)$P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$ (C)$P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$ (D)$P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$\n", "line_idx": 61}

  $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4=9 x-6$$Based on the equation above, what is the value of $3 x-2$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-4 (B)$-\\frac{4}{5}$ (C)$-\\frac{2}{3}$ (D)4\n", "line_idx": 62}

Choice $B$ is incorrect because 1.88 is not the approximate increase in a man's femur length for each increase of 32.01 inches in his height.

of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$H=1.88 L+32.01$$The formula above can be used to approximate the height $H$, in inches, of an adult male based on the length $L$, in inches, of his femur. What is the meaning of 1.88 in this context?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The approximate femur length, in inches, for a man with a height of 32.01 inches (B)The approximate increase in a man's femur length, in inches, for each increase of 32.01 inches in his height (C)The approximate increase in a man's femur length, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his height (D)The approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length\n", "line_idx": 63}

Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A painter will paint $n$ walls with the same size and shape in a building using a specific brand of paint. The painter's fee can be calculated by the expression $n K \\ell h$, where $n$ is the number of walls, $K$ is a constant with units of dollars per square foot, $\\ell$ is the length of each wall in feet, and $h$ is the height of each wall in feet. If the customer asks the painter to use a more expensive brand of paint, which of the factors in the expression would change?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$h$ (B)$\\ell$ (C)$K$ (D)$n$\n", "line_idx": 64}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following is equal to $a^{\\frac{2}{3}}$, for all values of $a$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\sqrt{a^{\\frac{1}{3}}}$ (B)$\\sqrt{a^{3}}$ (C)$\\sqrt[3]{a^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ (D)$\\sqrt[3]{a^{2}}$\n", "line_idx": 66}

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. If 30 states joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 and $x$ states joined between 1850 and 1900 , which of the following equations is true?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$30 x=2$ (B)$2 x=30$ (C)$\\frac{x}{2}=30$ (D)$x+30=2$\n", "line_idx": 67}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\\\\hline0 & 3 \\\\\\hline2 & 1 \\\\\\hline4 & 0 \\\\\\hline5 & -2 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial.

{"prompt_tokens": 2048, "completion_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 2237}, "metadata": 71, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The line $y=k x+4$, where $k$ is a constant, is graphed in the $x y$-plane. If the line contains the point $(c, d)$, where $c \\neq 0$ and $d \\neq 0$, what is the slope of the line in terms of $c$ and $d$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{d-4}{c}$ (B)$\\frac{c-4}{d}$ (C)$\\frac{4-d}{c}$ (D)$\\frac{4-c}{d}$\n", "line_idx": 71}

in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\\\& 4 x-5 y=7\\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{12}{5}$ (B)$\\frac{16}{7}$ (C)$-\\frac{16}{7}$ (D)$-\\frac{12}{5}$\n", "line_idx": 72}

graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$.

The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$-9 a$ (B)$-8 a$ (C)$-5 a$ (D)$-2 a$\n", "line_idx": 74}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{B}$ is correct. To solve for $a$, first multiply both sides of the equation by $a x-2$ to clear the denominators. Then, combine like terms on both sides of the equation and solve for $a$. This yields $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 a x^{2}-3 a x-53$, which can be rewritten as $8 a x^{2}+3 a x+100=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$ with real zeros, so it can be solved using the quadratic formula. The zeros of the equation are $x=\\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^{2}-4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 100}}{2 \\cdot 8}=\\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{-353}}{16}$. Since the equation is true for all values of $x \\neq \\frac{2}{a}$, the zeros of the equation must be $\\frac{-3+\\sqrt{-353}}{16}$ and $\\frac{2}{a}$. Setting these two values of $x$ equal to each other yields $\\frac{-3+\\sqrt{-353}}{16}=\\frac{2}{a}$, which can be solved for $a$ to yield $a=-3$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result

  $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The equation $\\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \\neq \\frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-16 (B)-3 (C)3 (D)16\n", "line_idx": 75}

Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    What are the solutions to $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0 ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$x=-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$ (B)$x=-2 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{3}$ (C)$x=-6 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$ (D)$x=-6 \\pm 6 \\sqrt{2}$\n", "line_idx": 76}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{A}$ is correct. Statement I is true. To see this, note that the equation $C=\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$ can be rewritten as $F=\\frac{9}{5}C+32$. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $F$ yields $\\frac{d F}{d C}=\\frac{9}{5}$. Therefore, a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to an increase of $\\frac{9}{5}$ degrees Fahrenheit.Statement II is false. To see this, note that the equation $C=\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$ can be rewritten as $F=\\frac{9}{5}C+32$. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $C$ yields $\\frac{d F}{d C}=\\frac{9}{5}$. Therefore, a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to an increase of $\\frac{9}{5}$ degrees Fahrenheit, not 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.Statement III is true. To see this, note that the equation $C=\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$ can be rewritten as $F=\\frac{9}{5}C+32$. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $F$ yields $\\frac{d C}{d F}=\\frac{5}{9}$. Therefore, a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to an increase of 1 degree Celsius.Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because statement II is false.

"completion_tokens": 381, "total_tokens": 2451}, "metadata": 77, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$C=\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$The equation above shows how a temperature $F$, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, relates to a temperature $C$, measured in degrees Celsius. Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.\nChoose from the following options:    (A)I only (B)II only (C)III only (D)I and II only\n", "line_idx": 77}

"Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c||c|}\\cline { 2 - 4 }\\multicolumn{1}{c||}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{c||}{Age} & \\multirow{2}{c|}{Total} \\\\\\hlineGender & Under 40 & 40 or older \\\\\\hline\\hlineMale & 12 & 2 & 14 \\\\\\hlineFemale & 8 & 3 & 11 \\\\\\hline\\hlineTotal & 20 & 5 & 25 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The table above shows the distribution of age and gender for 25 people who entered a contest.

{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The table shows that the function $f$ is linear, so it can be expressed in the form $f(n)=m n+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find the values of $m$ and $b$, two points from the table can be used. For example, the points $(1,-2)$ and $(2,1)$ can be used. The slope $m$ is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$ between the two points, so $m=\\frac{1-(-2)}{2-1}=3$. The $y$-intercept $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point where the graph of the line intersects the $y$-axis. Since the point $(1,-2)$ lies on the graph, the $y$-intercept is $b=-2$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(n)=3 n-2$.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect because these equations do not match the values in the table.\nFor example, for $n=2$, the value of $f(n)$ in the table is 1, but the values of $f(n)$ in choices $A, B$, and $D$ are 0, 2, and 4, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore C", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for",

  $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$f(n)=n-3$ (B)$f(n)=2 n-4$ (C)$f(n)=3 n-5$ (D)$f(n)=4 n-6$\n", "line_idx": 79}

circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    At Lincoln High School, approximately 7 percent of enrolled juniors and 5 percent of enrolled seniors were inducted into the National Honor Society last year. If there were 562 juniors and 602 seniors enrolled at Lincoln High School last year, which of the following is closest to the total number of juniors and seniors at Lincoln High School last year who were inducted into the National Honor Society?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)140 (B)69 (C)39 (D)30\n", "line_idx": 80}

Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& 3 x^{2}-5 x+2 \\\\& 5 x^{2}-2 x-6\\end{aligned}$$Which of the following is the sum of the two polynomials shown above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$8 x^{2}-7 x-4$ (B)$8 x^{2}+7 x-4$ (C)$8 x^{4}-7 x^{2}-4$ (D)$8 x^{4}+7 x^{2}-4$\n", "line_idx": 81}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $\\frac{3}{5} w=\\frac{4}{3}$, what is the value of $w ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{9}{20}$ (B)$\\frac{4}{5}$ (C)$\\frac{5}{4}$ (D)$\\frac{20}{9}$\n", "line_idx": 82}

{"prompt_tokens": 2052, "completion_tokens": 155, "total_tokens": 2207}, "metadata": 83, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The average number of students per classroom at Central High School from 2000 to 2010 can be modeled by the equation $y=0.56 x+27.2$, where $x$ represents the number of years since 2000 , and $y$ represents the average number of students per classroom. Which of the following best describes the meaning of the number 0.56 in the equation?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The total number of students at the school in 2000 (B)The average number of students per classroom in 2000 (C)The estimated increase in the average number of students per classroom each year (D)The estimated difference between the average number of students per classroom in 2010 and in 2000\n", "line_idx": 83}

Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds. If he walks at this same rate, which of the following is closest to the distance he will walk in 4 minutes?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)150 meters (B)450 meters (C)700 meters (D)1,400 meters\n", "line_idx": 84}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers.

In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   \\begin{center}.\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\\hline.\\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\\right)$ \\\\.\\hline\\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\\\.\\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\\\.\\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\\\.\\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\\\.\\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\\\.\\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\\\.\\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\\\.\\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\\\.\\hline.\\end{tabular}.\\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\sec ^{2}}\\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system.

{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$. Since the weight of the object on Earth is 150 newtons, the mass of the object is $m=\\frac{W}{g}=\\frac{150}{9.8}=15.3$ kilograms. To find the weight of the object on a different planet, we can use the formula $W=m g$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet. Since the weight of the object on the other planet is 170 newtons, we can solve for $g$ as follows: $170=15.3 g \\Rightarrow g=\\frac{170}{15.3}=11.1$. According to the chart, the acceleration due to gravity on Saturn is 11.1 $\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\sec ^{2}}$, so the weight of the object on Saturn is 170 newtons.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity on Venus, Uranus, and Neptune is not 11.1 $\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\nThe answer is therefore D", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex",

circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   \\begin{center}.\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\\hline.\\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\\right)$ \\\\.\\hline\\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\\\.\\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\\\.\\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\\\.\\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\\\.\\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\\\.\\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\\\.\\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\\\.\\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\\\.\\hline.\\end{tabular}.\\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\sec ^{2}}\\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system.

in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In order to determine if treatment $\\mathrm{X}$ is successful in improving eyesight, a research study was conducted. From a large population of people with poor eyesight, 300 participants were selected at random. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment $X$, and the other half did not receive treatment $X$. The resulting data showed that participants who received treatment $X$ had significantly improved eyesight as compared to those who did not receive treatment $X$. Based on the design and results of the study, which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)Treatment $\\mathrm{X}$ is likely to improve the eyesight of people who have poor eyesight. (B)Treatment $\\mathrm{X}$ improves eyesight better than all other available treatments. (C)Treatment $X$ will improve the eyesight of anyone who takes it. (D)Treatment $\\mathrm{X}$ will cause a substantial improvement in eyesight.\n", "line_idx": 88}

"Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   $$.\\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\\\.& D(P)=220-P.\\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars. How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\\$ 10$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units. (B)The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units. (C)The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units. (D)The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.\n", "line_idx": 89}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The quantity of the product supplied to the market is equal to the quantity of the product demanded by the market when $S(P)=D(P)$.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   $$.\\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\\\.& D(P)=220-P.\\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars. At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\$ 90$ (B)$\\$ 120$ (C)$\\$ 133$ (D)$\\$ 155$\n", "line_idx": 90}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   $$.\\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\\\.& D(P)=220-P.\\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars. Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)250 (B)350 (C)450 (D)1,350\n", "line_idx": 91}

answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Of the following four types of savings account plans, which option would yield exponential growth of the money in the account?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)Each successive year, $2 \\%$ of the initial savings is added to the value of the account. (B)Each successive year, $1.5 \\%$ of the initial savings and $\\$ 100$ is added to the value of the account. (C)Each successive year, $1 \\%$ of the current value is added to the value of the account. (D)Each successive year, $\\$ 100$ is added to the value of the account.\n", "line_idx": 92}

Since $x$ is $50 \\%$ more than the sum of $y$ and $z$, it follows that $x=1.5(y+z)$. Since the sum of the three numbers is 855, it follows that $x+y+z=855$. Substituting $x=1.5(y+z)$ into this equation yields $1.5(y+z)+y+z=855$. Simplifying this equation yields $2.5(y+z)=855$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $2.5$ yields $y+z=342$.

"context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The sum of three numbers is 855 . One of the numbers, $x$, is $50 \\%$ more than the sum of the other two numbers. What is the value of $x$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)570 (B)513 (C)214 (D)155\n", "line_idx": 93}

If Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution used is $3x$ milliliters. Since he has 5 milliliters left over, the total amount of solution in the beaker must be $3x+5$ milliliters. If he gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution used is $4x$ milliliters. Since he needs an additional 21 milliliters, the total amount of solution in the beaker must be $4x+21$ milliliters. Since the total amount of solution in the beaker is the same in both cases, it follows that $3x+5=4x+21$. Solving this equation for $x$ yields $x=23$.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)16 (B)21 (C)23 (D)26\n", "line_idx": 94}

The line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin if and only if the coordinates of the origin, $(0, 0)$, are a solution to the equation of the line. The equation of the line can be determined using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which states that the equation of the line through two points $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ is given by $y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})$, where $m$ is the slope of the line. The slope of the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ is $\\frac{32-k}{k-2}$. Substituting the coordinates of the origin into the equation of the line yields $0-0=\\frac{32-k}{k-2}(0-2)$. Solving for $k$ yields $k=0$.Choices $B, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because the equation of the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ does not have a solution for $k$ equal to 4, 8, or

{"prompt_tokens": 1978, "completion_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 2270}, "metadata": 95, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0 (B)4 (C)8 (D)16\n", "line_idx": 95}

Since the area of the rectangle decreased by 12 percent, the area of the rectangle after the alterations is $0.88$ times the area of the original rectangle. Thus, the following equation must be true: $(1.1 l)(1-p/100) w=0.88 l w$.

problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)12 (B)15 (C)20 (D)22\n", "line_idx": 96}

Therefore, the population of the city $t$ years from now can be expressed as $50,000 \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{\\frac{t}{20}}$.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the exponent should be $\\frac{t}{20}$, not $20 t$.

2269}, "metadata": 97, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$ (B)$50,000(0.1)^{\\frac{t}{20}}$ (C)$50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$ (D)$50,000(0.9)^{\\frac{t}{20}}$\n", "line_idx": 97}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Let $n_{LF}$ represent the number of left-handed female students, $n_{RF}$ represent the number of right-handed female students, $n_{LM}$ represent the number of left-handed male students, and $n_{RM}$ represent the number of right-handed male students. Since there are 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, it follows that $n_{LF}+n_{LM}=18$ and $n_{RF}+n_{RM}=122$. Also, since there are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, it follows that $n_{RF}=5 n_{LF}$. Similarly, since there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students, it follows that $n_{RM}=9 n_{LM}$. Solving the system of equations yields $n_{LF}=2, n_{RF}=10, n_{LM}=16$, and $n_{RM}=144$. Therefore, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is $\\frac{n_{RF}}{n_{RF}+n_{RM}}=\\frac{10}{10+144}=\\frac{10}{154} \\approx 0.357$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are

the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\\cline { 2 - 3 }\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\\\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\\\\hline\\hlineFemale &  &  \\\\\\hlineMale &  &  \\\\\\hline\\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School.

If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female?

Since $b$ is $c$ minus $\\frac{1}{2}$, the first equation can be rewritten as $3 x+\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=5 x-7$. Subtracting $3 x$ from both sides yields $c-\\frac{1}{2}=-2 x-7$. Adding $\\frac{1}{2}$ to both sides yields $c=-2 x-\\frac{7}{2}$. Similarly, the second equation can be rewritten as $3 y+c=5 y-7$, which can be rearranged to $c=-2 y-\\frac{7}{2}$. Since $c$ is the same in both equations, it follows that $-2 x-\\frac{7}{2}=-2 y-\\frac{7}{2}$. Subtracting $\\frac{7}{2}$ from both sides yields $-2 x=-2 y$.

"Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& 3 x+b=5 x-7 \\\\& 3 y+c=5 y-7\\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ are constants.If $b$ is $c$ minus $\\frac{1}{2}$, which of the following is true?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$x$ is $y$ minus $\\frac{1}{4}$.

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following is equivalent to the sum of the expressions $a^{2}-1$ and $a+1$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$a^{2}+a$ (B)$a^{3}-1$ (C)$2 a^{2}$ (D)$a^{3}$\n", "line_idx": 102}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice A is correct. The given equation states that the speed of sound $S$ is a linear function of the air temperature $T$. The number 331.4 is the $y$-intercept of the graph of the function $S(T)$. Since the $x$-intercept of the graph of a linear function is the point at which the graph intersects the $x$-axis, the $y$-intercept of the graph of a linear function is the point at which the graph intersects the $y$-axis. In this case, the $y$-intercept is the speed of sound, in meters per second, when the air temperature is 0 degrees Celsius.Choices $B, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because the number 331.4 is not related

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In air, the speed of sound $S$, in meters per second, is a linear function of the air temperature $T$, in degrees Celsius, and is given by $S(T)=0.6 T+331.4$.

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis.

are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$, which of the following is equivalent to $4 z+8 y$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(a+2 b)^{2}$ (B)$(2 a+2 b)^{2}$ (C)$(4 a+4 b)^{2}$ (D)$(4 a+8 b)^{2}$\n", "line_idx": 105}

$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\sqrt[3]{9}$ (B)$\\sqrt[4]{9}$ (C)$\\sqrt{3}$ (D)$3 \\sqrt{3}$\n", "line_idx": 107}

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    At a restaurant, $n$ cups of tea are made by adding $t$ tea bags to hot water. If $t=n+2$, how many additional tea bags are needed to make each additional cup of tea?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)None (B)One (C)Two (D)Three\n", "line_idx": 108}

$x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers.

In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

"completion_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 2256}, "metadata": 110, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\\\\hline1 & 5 \\\\\\hline3 & 13 \\\\\\hline5 & 21 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The weight of an object on Venus is approximately $\\frac{9}{10}$ of its weight on Earth. The weight of an object on Jupiter is approximately $\\frac{23}{10}$ of its weight on Earth. If an object weighs 100 pounds on Earth, approximately how many more pounds does it weigh on Jupiter than it weighs on Venus?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)90 (B)111 (C)140 (D)230\n", "line_idx": 113}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    An online bookstore sells novels and magazines. Each novel sells for $\\$ 4$, and each magazine sells for $\\$ 1$. If Sadie purchased a total of 11 novels and magazines that have a combined selling price of $\\$ 20$, how many novels did she purchase?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)2 (B)3 (C)4 (D)5\n", "line_idx": 114}

For example, if $n=2$ and $b=10$, then the value of the function in choice $B$ is $y=2 x-10$.

answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The Downtown Business Association (DB(A)in a certain city plans to increase its membership by a total of $n$ businesses per year. There were $b$ businesses in the DBA at the beginning of this year. Which function best models the total number of businesses, $y$, the DBA plans to have as members $x$ years from now?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$y=n x+b$ (B)$y=n x-b$ (C)$y=b(n)^{x}$ (D)$y=n(b)^{x}$\n", "line_idx": 115}

Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following is an equivalent form of $(1.5 x-2.4)^{2}-\\left(5.2 x^{2}-6.4\\right) ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$-2.2 x^{2}+1.6$ (B)$-2.2 x^{2}+11.2$ (C)$-2.95 x^{2}-7.2 x+12.16$ (D)$-2.95 x^{2}-7.2 x+0.64$\n", "line_idx": 116}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The density $d$ of an object is found by dividing the mass $m$ of the object by its volume $V$. Which of the following equations gives the mass $m$ in terms of $d$ and $V$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$m=d V$ (B)$m=\\frac{d}{V}$ (C)$m=\\frac{V}{d}$ (D)$m=V+d$\n", "line_idx": 117}

Therefore, the equation of the line perpendicular to the given line is $y=-\\frac{3}{2} x+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since the given line passes through the point $(0,2)$, the line perpendicular to it must also pass through this point. Thus, $2=-\\frac{3}{2}(0)+b$, or $b=2$.

"completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 2266}, "metadata": 118, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{array}{r}\\frac{1}{2} y=4 \\\\x-\\frac{1}{2} y=2\\end{array}$$The system of equations above has solution $(x, y)$. What is the value of $x$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)3 (B)$\\frac{7}{2}$ (C)4 (D)6\n", "line_idx": 119}

{"prompt_tokens": 2003, "completion_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 2244}, "metadata": 120, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\\hline\\multirow{2}{*}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Type of } \\\\\\text { surgeon }\\end{array}$} & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Major professional } \\\\\\text { activity }\\end{array}$} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Total} \\\\\\cline { 2 - 3 }& Teaching & Research \\\\\\hlineGeneral & 258 & 156 & 414 \\\\\\hlineOrthopedic & 119 & 74 & 193 \\\\\\hlineTotal & 377 & 230 & 607 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}In a survey, 607 general surgeons and orthopedic surgeons indicated their major professional activity.

the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A polling agency recently surveyed 1,000 adults who were selected at random from a large city and asked each of the adults, \"Are you satisfied with the quality of air in the city?\" Of those surveyed, 78 percent responded that they were satisfied with the quality of air in the city. Based on the results of the survey, which of the following statements must be true?I. Of all adults in the city, 78 percent are satisfied with the quality of air in the city.II. If another 1,000 adults selected at random from the city were surveyed, 78 percent of them would report they are satisfied with the quality of air in the city.III. If 1,000 adults selected at random from a different city were surveyed, 78 percent of them would report they are satisfied with the quality of air in the city.\nChoose from the following options:    (A)None (B)II only (C)I and II only (D)I and III only\n", "line_idx": 122}

Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   \\begin{center}.\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\\hline.\\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Species of tree} & Growth factor \\\\.\\hline.Red maple & 4.5 \\\\.\\hline.River birch & 3.5 \\\\.\\hline.Cottonwood & 2.0 \\\\.\\hline.Black walnut & 4.5 \\\\.\\hline.White birch & 5.0 \\\\.\\hline.American elm & 4.0 \\\\.\\hline.Pin oak & 3.0 \\\\.\\hline.Shagbark hickory & 7.5 \\\\.\\hline.\\end{tabular}.\\end{center}.One method of calculating the approximate age, in years, of a tree of a particular species is to multiply the diameter of the tree, in inches, by a constant called the growth factor for that species.

is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If a white birch tree and a pin oak tree each now have a diameter of 1 foot, which of the following will be closest to the difference, in inches, of their diameters 10 years from now? $(1$ foot $=12$ inches $)$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.0 (B)1.2 (C)1.3 (D)1.4\n", "line_idx": 124}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. Since $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, $a-b$ is negative. Therefore, the numerator of the fraction is negative, and the fraction is negative. Since the denominator of the fraction is positive, the fraction is less than $-1$. Therefore, $c<-1$.Choice $A$ is incorrect because $c$ cannot be greater than 1 if the fraction is negative. Choices $B$ and $C$ are incorrect because $c$ cannot be equal to 1 or $-1$ if the fraction is negative.\nThe answer is therefore D", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem", " 6", ":", "  ", " Choice", " $\\", "math", "bf", "{", "D", "}", "$", " is", " correct", ".", " Since", " $", "a", "$", " is", " negative", " and", " $", "b", "$", " is", " positive", ",", " $", "a", "-", "b", "$", " is", " negative", ".", " Therefore", ",", " the", " numer", "ator", " of", " the", " fraction", " is", " negative", ",", " and", " the", " fraction", " is", " negative", ".", " Since", " the", " denomin", "ator", " of", " the", " fraction", " is", " positive", ",", " the", " fraction", " is", " less", " than", " $", "-", "1", "$.", " Therefore", ",", " $", "c", "<", "-", "1", "$.", "Choice", " $", "A", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " $", "c", "$", " cannot", " be", " greater", " than", " 1", " if", " the", " fraction", " is", " negative", ".", " Cho", "ices", " $", "B", "$", " and", " $", "C", "$", " are", " incorrect", " because", " $", "c", "$", " cannot", " be", " equal", " to", " 1", " or", " $", "-", "1", "$", " if", " the", " fraction", " is", " negative", ".", "\n", "The", " answer", " is", " therefore", " D", "<|endoftext|>"], "token_logprobs": [-1.3542607e-05, -0.00212557, -2.5105857e-05, -2.0966954e-06, -0.00025646458, -0.00022600066, -0.00019845407, -0.0009151844, -0.026582059, -0.001721148, -0.7867645, -0.002071932, -0.062256087, -0.0007085461, -0.09861847, -0.000440229, -0.00039127364, -0.00043044917, -0.00037708215, -0.0007710564, -0.54532945, -0.023938539, -0.0020153117, -0.010881665, -0.077705875, -0.002006293, -0.018988004, -0.0008694252, -0.00049825077, -0.00029569364, -0.0003392808, -0.0002934296, -0.006375787, -0.87653124, -0.013199908, -0.066773154, -0.0013132492, -0.19923316, -0.43121967, -0.17218602, -0.4040135, -0.8500798, -0.002469087, -1.3104478, -1.5629703, -9.251094e-06, -0.29352573, -0.02566592, -0.2529879, -0.93563867, -0.014300154, -0.81100976, -0.4171348, -0.46055517, -0.5899982, -0.54138434, -0.3482473, -0.40358573, -0.52523774, -0.72092265, -0.4791452, -7.827482e-05, -0.77696365, -0.01880116, -0.0019548729, -0.07911266, -0.57461494, -0.052010942, -0.5031081, -0.31579322, -0.36374593, -0.53446984, -0.0010623733, -0.31099874, -0.011322122, -0.004231424, -0.5068412, -1.7610894, -0.0033510653, -0.35227102, -0.0022930733, -0.34774527, -0.002998933, -0.0006144238, -0.22286655, -0.76767576, -0.1378546, -0.0019942268, -0.00044177964, -0.00039592464, -0.00041244208, -0.63345563, -1.0888325, -0.3353873, -0.1853836, -0.98679924, -0.010992183, -0.050991036, -0.0002850831, -0.24200298, -1.3275794, -0.18586907, -0.22556505, -0.045891594, -0.043287937, -0.01365637, -0.79264504, -4.9586424e-06, -0.070383966, -0.0012544625, -0.00093433383, -0.00070079096, -0.06353268, -0.0002903283, -0.0001821234, -0.00084144867, -0.01077755, -0.08219211, -0.9053526, -0.10155298, -0.10504513, -0.18215384, -0.38531038, -0.16122732, -0.0008391809, -0.10738516, -0.027791748, -0.9151852, -0.0015602494, -0.00092878635, -0.06565274, -0.021813089, -0.0057104668, -0.02547844, -0.0008029697, -0.031318836, -0.0022551357, -0.046186928, -0.017685521, -8.1256905e-05, -8.5549356e-05, -0.0013436314, -0.00035215908, -0.012877137], "top_logprobs": null, "text_offset": [6257, 6257, 6259, 6263, 6268, 6272, 6280, 6282, 6283, 6285, 6292, 6295, 6299, 6301, 6302, 6303, 6304, 6305, 6308, 6316, 6317, 6323, 6325, 6326, 6327, 6330, 6339, 6343, 6345, 6346, 6347, 6350, 6359, 6360, 6362, 6363, 6364, 6365, 6366, 6369, 6378, 6379, 6389, 6390, 6394, 6400, 6404, 6407, 6411, 6420, 6423, 6432, 6433, 6437, 6441, 6450, 6453, 6462, 6463, 6469, 6473, 6481, 6485, 6488, 6492, 6501, 6504, 6513, 6514, 6518, 6527, 6530, 6535, 6540, 6542, 6543, 6544, 6546, 6556, 6557, 6559, 6560, 6561, 6562, 6563, 6565, 6571, 6573, 6574, 6575, 6578, 6588, 6596, 6598, 6599, 6600, 6607, 6610, 6618, 6623, 6625, 6628, 6632, 6641, 6644, 6653, 6654, 6658, 6662, 6664, 6665, 6666, 6670, 6672, 6673, 6674, 6678, 6688, 6696, 6698, 6699, 6700, 6707, 6710, 6716, 6719, 6721, 6724, 6726, 6727, 6728, 6729, 6732, 6736, 6745, 6748, 6757, 6758, 6759, 6762, 6769, 6772, 6782, 6784]}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1988, "completion_tokens": 143, "total_tokens": 2131}, "metadata": 125, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\frac{a-b}{a}=c$$In the equation above, if $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, which of the following must be true?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$c>1$ (B)$c=1$ (C)$c=-1$ (D)$c<-1$\n", "line_idx": 125}

are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In State X, Mr. Camp's eighth-grade class consisting of 26 students was surveyed and 34.6 percent of the students reported that they had at least two siblings. The average eighth-grade class size in the state is 26. If the students in Mr. Camp's class are representative of students in the state's eighth-grade classes and there are 1,800 eighth-grade classes in the state, which of the following best estimates the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have fewer than two siblings?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)16,200 (B)23,400 (C)30,600 (D)46,800 Questions 23 and 24 refer to the following information.\n", "line_idx": 126}

The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function of the form $r(p)=m p+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find the values of $m$ and $b$, two points on the line must be found. The points can be found by substituting the given values of $p$ and $r$ into the equation. For example, for the property on Clearwater Lane, $p=128$ and $r=950$. Substituting these values into the equation yields $950=m(128)+b$. Solving for $m$ yields $m=6.5$. Substituting this value of $m$ into the equation and solving for $b$ yields $b=440$. Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is $r(p)=6.5

$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\\hline\\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Townsend Realty Group Investments} \\\\\\hlineProperty address & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Purchase price } \\\\ \\text { (dollars) }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Monthly rental } \\\\ \\text { price } \\\\ \\text { (dollars) }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hlineClearwater Lane & 128,000 & 950 \\\\\\hlineDriftwood Drive & 176,000 & 1,310 \\\\\\hlineEdgemont Street & 70,000 & 515 \\\\\\hlineGlenview Street & 140,000 & 1,040 \\\\\\hlineHamilton Circle & 450,000 & 3,365 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The Townsend Realty Group invested in the five different properties listed in the table above.

In addition, Townsend Realty received an additional $20 \\%$ off the discounted price, so the final price is $0.6 P-0.2(0.6 P)=0.48 P$.

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Townsend Realty purchased the Glenview Street property and received a $40 \\%$ discount off the original price along with an additional $20 \\%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash. Which of the following best approximates the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\$ 350,000$ (B)$\\$ 291,700$ (C)$\\$ 233,300$ (D)$\\$ 175,000$\n", "line_idx": 128}

The total number of participants in the experiment is 300, and 36 of the first 150 participants chose the first picture in the set. Therefore, the total number of participants who chose the first picture in the set is $36+p$, where $p$ is the number of participants in the second group of 150 who chose the first picture in the set. Since more than $20 \\%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, the following inequality must be true: $\\frac{36+p}{300}>0.2$. Solving for $p$ yields $p+36>0.2(300)$. Since $p$ is the number of participants in the second group of 150, $p$ must be less than or equal to 150.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the inequality given in this choice is not true for all values of $p$. For example, if $p=150$, then the inequality is false. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the inequality given in this choice is not true for all values of $p$. For example, if $p=0$, then the inequality is false. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the inequality given in this choice is not true for all values of $p$.

129, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A psychologist set up an experiment to study the tendency of a person to select the first item when presented with a series of items. In the experiment, 300 people were presented with a set of five pictures arranged in random order. Each person was asked to choose the most appealing picture. Of the first 150 participants, 36 chose the first picture in the set. Among the remaining 150 participants, $p$ people chose the first picture in the set. If more than $20 \\%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, which of the following inequalities best describes the possible values of $p$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \\leq 150$ (B)$p>0.20(300+36)$, where $p \\leq 150$ (C)$p-36>0.20(300)$, where $p \\leq 150$ (D)$p+36>0.20(300)$, where $p \\leq 150$\n", "line_idx": 129}

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The surface area of a cube is $6\\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^{2}$, where $a$ is a positive constant. Which of the following gives the perimeter of one face of the cube?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{a}{4}$ (B)$a$ (C)$4 a$ (D)$6 a$\n", "line_idx": 130}

the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The mean score of 8 players in a basketball game was 14.5 points. If the highest individual score is removed, the mean score of the remaining 7 players becomes 12 points. What was the highest score?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)20 (B)24 (C)32 (D)36\n", "line_idx": 131}

The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. To find the center of the circle, we can rearrange the given equation to the standard form. First, subtract $20$ from both sides of the equation to get $x^{2}+y^{2}+16 y=-40$. Then, subtract $16 y$ from both sides of the equation to get $x^{2}+y^{2}=-40-16 y$. Finally, subtract $x^{2}$ from both sides of the equation to get $y^{2}=-40-16 y-x^{2}$. This is the standard form of the equation of a circle, with the center at $(-10,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because these points do not satisfy the equation of the circle.\nThe answer

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$x^{2}+20 x+y^{2}+16 y=-20$$The equation above defines a circle in the $x y$-plane. What are the coordinates of the center of the circle?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(-20,-16)$ (B)$(-10,-8)$ (C)$(10,8)$ (D)$(20,16)$\n", "line_idx": 132}

"completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 2302}, "metadata": 133, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$y=x^{2}-a$$In the equation above, $a$ is a positive constant and the graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following is an equivalent form of the equation?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$y=(x+a)(x-a)$ (B)$y=(x+\\sqrt{a})(x-\\sqrt{a})$ (C)$y=\\left(x+\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)$ (D)$y=(x+a)^{2}$ DIRECTIONS\n", "line_idx": 133}

Choice $D$ is incorrect because the equation does not state that the number of minutes spent biking for each minute spent running is 75.\nThe answer is therefore C", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem", " 6", ":", "  ", " Choice", " C", " is", " correct", ".", " The", " equation", " $", "x", "+", "y", "=", "75", "$", " states", " that", " the", " sum", " of", " the", " number", " of", " minutes", " Maria", " spends", " running", " and", " the", " number", " of", " minutes", " she", " spends", " biking", " is", " 75", ".", " Therefore", ",", " the", " number", " 75", " represents", " the", " total", " number", " of", " minutes", " spent", " running", " and", " biking", " each", " day", ".", "Choice", " $", "A", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " equation", " does", " not", " state", " that", " the", " number", " of", " minutes", " spent", " running", " each", " day", " is", " 75", ".", " Choice", " $", "B", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " equation", " does", " not", " state", " that", " the", " number", " of", " minutes", " spent", " biking", " each", " day", " is", " 75", ".", " Choice", " $", "D", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " equation", " does", " not", " state", " that", " the", " number", " of", " minutes", " spent", " biking", " for", " each", " minute", " spent", " running", " is", " 75", ".", "\n", "The", " answer", " is", " therefore", " C", "<|endoftext|>", " §§", " FILE", " READ", "ME", ".", "md"], "token_logprobs": [-1.163433e-05, -0.009320963, -2.2126573e-05, -4.277735e-07, -0.00020250905, -0.0003426196, -0.00019177745, -0.00035382994, -0.038363583, -0.003467213, -0.4224586, -0.0002382219, -0.0006799144, -0.0005148311, -0.36435762, -0.21390723, -0.31210575, -0.00026051674, -0.0039162007, -0.00056450826, -0.00058060983, -0.0013054331, -0.0021794506, -0.4265398, -0.0015171483, -0.079110205, -0.5257416, -0.00088970846, -0.16271268, -0.14882568, -0.00062957645, -0.0002416799, -0.7244479, -0.0027192438, -0.0011657234, -0.60058707, -0.15220152, -0.00031584647, -0.000908382, -0.00028031383, -0.12291461, -0.0006813459, -0.0004988487, -0.68004704, -0.55531776, -0.1602247, -0.99698466, -0.0007847767, -0.6496929, -0.037899975, -0.0065213875, -0.13284019, -0.00020835307, -0.0031965973, -0.01345542, -0.0006901748, -0.00015016893, -0.4606517, -0.0062681194, -0.0003754123, -0.00014468438, -0.014575661, -6.778445e-05, -0.0067000655, -0.80170125, -0.11782348, -0.0005062424, -0.0013210081, -0.00057583966, -0.00020346364, -0.44613886, -0.4363171, -0.3174972, -0.07494193, -0.00010951312, -1.1822941, -0.5360434, -0.792788, -0.04219115, -0.048522756, -0.0002534825, -0.586859, -0.00033135017, -0.5928831, -8.5905114e-05, -0.0074090976, -0.064005345, -0.09795417, -0.24184515, -0.11269575, -0.0006900547, -0.00018116974, -0.00043641243, -0.009355439, -0.1869104, -0.008357745, -0.0020656027, -0.0032537652, -0.0001015252, -0.005695419, -0.002522805, -0.0012451529, -0.00047004616, -0.00019499795, -0.000106175285, -0.00339562, -0.00045466074, -0.0016867588, -0.0005850234, -0.0001779483, -0.00023488217, -0.00821753, -0.045612935, -0.27045366, -0.0009436406, -0.00017961723, -0.00075059576, -0.0014214624, -0.038302764, -0.023241678, -0.007910666, -0.018062703, -0.00024787875, -0.49638817, -0.0782235, -0.14957277, -0.056110833, -0.00074427295, -9.21049e-05, -0.027983036, -0.0028026828, -0.47572806, -0.012853835, -0.0013972876, -0.0035096803, -0.00015255497, -0.0014079111, -0.007549319, -0.0062100627, -0.03499801, -0.0029066917, -7.040798e-05, -9.401318e-05, -0.0013384961, -0.00034595837, -0.012147263, -0.009742135, -0.0005647438, -1.2895538, -0.00017711478, -0.00045275246, -8.268835e-05], "top_logprobs": null, "text_offset": [6535, 6535, 6537, 6541, 6546, 6550, 6558, 6560, 6561, 6563, 6570, 6572, 6575, 6583, 6584, 6588, 6597, 6599, 6600, 6601, 6602, 6603, 6605, 6606, 6613, 6618, 6622, 6626, 6629, 6633, 6640, 6643, 6651, 6657, 6664, 6672, 6676, 6680, 6687, 6690, 6698, 6702, 6709, 6716, 6719, 6722, 6723, 6733, 6734, 6738, 6745, 6748, 6759, 6763, 6769, 6776, 6779, 6787, 6793, 6801, 6805, 6812, 6817, 6821, 6822, 6828, 6830, 6831, 6832, 6835, 6845, 6853, 6857, 6866, 6871, 6875, 6881, 6886, 6890, 6897, 6900, 6908, 6914, 6922, 6927, 6931, 6934, 6937, 6938, 6945, 6947, 6948, 6949, 6952, 6962, 6970, 6974, 6983, 6988, 6992, 6998, 7003, 7007, 7014, 7017, 7025, 7031, 7038, 7043, 7047, 7050, 7053, 7054, 7061, 7063, 7064, 7065, 7068, 7078, 7086, 7090, 7099, 7104, 7108, 7114, 7119, 7123, 7130, 7133, 7141, 7147, 7154, 7158, 7163, 7170, 7176, 7184, 7187, 7190, 7191, 7192, 7195, 7202, 7205, 7215, 7217, 7217, 7217, 7217, 7217, 7217, 7217]}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2016, "completion_tokens": 145, "total_tokens": 2161}, "metadata": 134, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$x+y=75$$The equation above relates the number of minutes, $x$, Maria spends running each day and the number of minutes, $y$, she spends biking each day. In the equation, what does the number 75 represent?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The number of minutes spent running each day (B)The number of minutes spent biking each day (C)The total number of minutes spent running and biking each day (D)The number of minutes spent biking for each minute spent running\n", "line_idx": 134}

Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following is equivalent to $3(x+5)-6$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$3 x-3$ (B)$3 x-1$ (C)$3 x+9$ (D)$15 x-6$\n", "line_idx": 135}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $f(x)=\\frac{x^{2}-6 x+3}{x-1}$, what is $f(-1)$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-5 (B)-2 (C)2 (D)5\n", "line_idx": 138}

$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\$ 10,800$ (B)$\\$ 16,200$ (C)$\\$ 21,600$ (D)$\\$ 29,700$\n", "line_idx": 139}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$.

Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$x^{2}+6 x+4$$Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(x+3)^{2}+5$ (B)$(x+3)^{2}-5$ (C)$(x-3)^{2}+5$ (D)$(x-3)^{2}-5$\n", "line_idx": 140}

"completion_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 2269}, "metadata": 141, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \\%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\\$ 270$ for the week?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)38 (B)33 (C)22 (D)16\n", "line_idx": 141}

exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Marisa needs to hire at least 10 staff members for an upcoming project. The staff members will be made up of junior directors, who will be paid $\\$ 640$ per week, and senior directors, who will be paid $\\$ 880$ per week. Her budget for paying the staff members is no more than $\\$ 9,700$ per week. She must hire at least 3 junior directors and at least 1 senior director. Which of the following systems of inequalities represents the conditions described if $x$ is the number of junior directors and $y$ is the number of senior directors?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$640 x+880 y \\geq 9,700$ $x+y \\leq 10$ $x \\geq 3$ $y \\geq 1$ (B)$640 x+880 y \\leq 9,700$ $x+y \\geq 10$ $x \\geq 3$ $y \\geq 1$ (C)$640 x+880 y \\geq 9,700$ $x+y \\geq 10$ $x \\leq 3$ $y \\leq 1$ (D)$640 x+880 y \\leq 9,700$ $x+y \\leq 10$ $x \\leq 3$ $y \\leq 1$\n", "line_idx": 142}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d=0$$In the equation above, $a, b, c$, and $d$ are constants. If the equation has roots $-1,-3$, and 5 , which of the following is a factor of $a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$x-1$ (B)$x+1$ (C)$x-3$ (D)$x+5$\n", "line_idx": 143}

Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is $-2$.Choice $A$ is incorrect because $-2$ is not in the interval $-4<x<-3$.

of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$-4<x<-3$ (B)$-3<x<1$ (C)$1<x<3$ (D)$3<x<4$\n", "line_idx": 144}

This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following expressions is equivalent to $\\frac{x^{2}-2 x-5}{x-3} ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$x-5-\\frac{20}{x-3}$ (B)$x-5-\\frac{10}{x-3}$ (C)$x+1-\\frac{8}{x-3}$ (D)$x+1-\\frac{2}{x-3}$\n", "line_idx": 145}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{B}$ is correct. The perimeter of the base of the box is determined using the width and length of the box. Since the length of the box is 2.5 times the width, the perimeter of the base is $2(x+2.5 x)=6 x$. The restriction states that the sum of the perimeter of the base and the height of the box cannot exceed 130 inches. Thus, the following inequality must be satisfied: $6 x+60 \\leq 130$.

exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A shipping service restricts the dimensions of the boxes it will ship for a certain type of service. The restriction states that for boxes shaped like rectangular prisms, the sum of the perimeter of the base of the box and the height of the box cannot exceed 130 inches. The perimeter of the base is determined using the width and length of the box. If a box has a height of 60 inches and its length is 2.5 times the width, which inequality shows the allowable width $x$, in inches, of the box?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$0<x \\leq 10$ (B)$0<x \\leq 11 \\frac{2}{3}$ (C)$0<x \\leq 17 \\frac{1}{2}$ (D)$0<x \\leq 20$\n", "line_idx": 146}

The expression $\\frac{1}{3} x^{2}-2$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{3}(x^{2}-2 k^{2})$, where $k$ is a positive constant. Since the expression is in the form of a perfect square trinomial, it can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{3}(x-k)(x+k)$. To find the value of $k$, we can solve the equation $x^{2}-2 k^{2}=0$ for $k$. This equation can be rewritten as $k^{2}=\\frac{x^{2}}{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $k=\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{x^{2}}{2}}$.

"context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The expression $\\frac{1}{3} x^{2}-2$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{3}(x-k)(x+k)$, where $k$ is a positive constant.What is the value of $k$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)2 (B)6 (C)$\\sqrt{2}$ (D)$\\sqrt{6}$\n", "line_idx": 147}

According to the table, the number of dogs fed only dry food is 2, and the total number of dogs is 25. Therefore, the fraction of dogs fed only dry food is $\\frac{2}{25}$.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the total number of animals at the pet care facility is 41, not 7. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the number of dogs fed only dry food is 2, not 7. Choice $D$ is incorrect because the total number of dogs is 25, not 7.\nThe answer is therefore B", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem", " 6", ":", "  ", " Choice", " B", " is", " correct", ".", " The", " fraction", " of", " dogs", " fed", " only", " dry", " food", " is", " the", " number", " of", " dogs", " fed", " only", " dry", " food", " divided", " by", " the", " total", " number", " of", " dogs", ".", " According", " to", " the", " table", ",", " the", " number", " of", " dogs", " fed", " only", " dry", " food", " is", " 2", ",", " and", " the", " total", " number", " of", " dogs", " is", " 25", ".", " Therefore", ",", " the", " fraction", " of", " dogs", " fed", " only", " dry", " food", " is", " $\\", "frac", "{", "2", "}{", "25", "}", "$.", "Choice", " $", "A", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " total", " number", " of", " animals", " at", " the", " pet", " care", " facility", " is", " 41", ",", " not", " 7", ".", " Choice", " $", "C", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " number", " of", " dogs", " fed", " only", " dry", " food", " is", " 2", ",", " not", " 7", ".", " Choice", " $", "D", "$", " is", " incorrect", " because", " the", " total", " number", " of", " dogs", " is", " 25", ",", " not", " 7", ".", "\n", "The", " answer", " is", " therefore", " B", "<|endoftext|>"], "token_logprobs": [-2.558363e-05, -0.0063864663, -1.6642034e-05, -7.818713e-06, -0.00026481107, -0.00033510666, -0.00033272154, -0.00052556646, -0.032693427, -0.0014428918, -0.6808134, -0.0004287793, -0.0006243275, -0.00047112093, -0.45872185, -0.58541745, -0.017332314, -0.29261795, -0.23587362, -0.0007430809, -0.00026385646, -0.0001459938, -0.50483036, -0.82908684, -0.36464965, -0.0010596277, -0.13204244, -0.037910067, -0.021802489, -0.0005339749, -9.317965e-05, -0.3419818, -0.00024740095, -0.0027611991, -0.0012117351, -0.00039330113, -0.0001229837, -0.002692466, -0.4444473, -1.5110029, -0.0021100985, -0.00010557923, -0.10054564, -0.007569859, -0.68167466, -0.019027065, -0.00061895844, -0.004077423, -0.0023433755, -0.00081943546, -0.00010140506, -8.256821e-05, -0.00089842005, -0.025182677, -0.7303476, -0.030082898, -0.0022100338, -0.0007061591, -0.0002176523, -0.00028866032, -0.0004835843, -0.0030776116, -0.00072447216, -0.04836735, -0.6348276, -0.002430669, -0.0085404795, -0.011228086, -0.039590236, -0.015099974, -0.002947221, -0.0004645588, -9.139247e-05, -0.00014301545, -0.0078424355, -0.027776673, -0.0008986594, -0.0019001075, -7.136165e-05, -0.0010931029, -0.00037433943, -0.02102079, -0.032745097, -0.83033395, -0.23131245, -0.0016536799, -0.00030666363, -0.0005045725, -0.00020203409, -0.57154536, -0.7955116, -0.40935212, -0.0039356505, -0.0032343904, -0.5061464, -1.0470561, -0.0014677801, -0.19855352, -0.009707587, -0.0015495638, -0.05776702, -0.030491572, -0.11228434, -0.051565558, -1.1023176, -0.04541407, -0.69532704, -0.20282951, -0.0017588846, -0.00017329915, -0.0006682836, -0.00071212515, -0.0719489, -0.411633, -0.9208109, -0.002428278, -0.777197, -0.064727515, -0.0025035662, -0.00030106178, -0.00023500233, -0.03081116, -0.069823466, -0.022025721, -0.009777347, -0.0012671774, -0.013815357, -0.046969067, -0.18618856, -0.0007839423, -0.00013133019, -0.00037016338, -0.00021049884, -0.05177225, -0.03404237, -0.7868014, -0.00043533952, -0.00014611395, -0.101207584, -0.043610964, -0.011100303, -0.007231131, -0.0021609329, -0.0012468238, -0.005645907, -0.034834567, -0.0023794028, -6.885639e-05, -0.00011905076, -0.0003998604, -0.00040534776, -0.020469148], "top_logprobs": null, "text_offset": [6658, 6658, 6660, 6664, 6669, 6673, 6681, 6683, 6684, 6686, 6693, 6695, 6698, 6706, 6707, 6711, 6720, 6723, 6728, 6732, 6737, 6741, 6746, 6749, 6753, 6760, 6763, 6768, 6772, 6777, 6781, 6786, 6794, 6797, 6801, 6807, 6814, 6817, 6822, 6823, 6833, 6836, 6840, 6846, 6847, 6851, 6858, 6861, 6866, 6870, 6875, 6879, 6884, 6887, 6889, 6890, 6894, 6898, 6904, 6911, 6914, 6919, 6922, 6925, 6926, 6936, 6937, 6941, 6950, 6953, 6958, 6962, 6967, 6971, 6976, 6979, 6982, 6986, 6987, 6988, 6990, 6992, 6993, 6995, 7001, 7003, 7004, 7005, 7008, 7018, 7026, 7030, 7036, 7043, 7046, 7054, 7057, 7061, 7065, 7070, 7079, 7082, 7085, 7086, 7090, 7092, 7093, 7100, 7102, 7103, 7104, 7107, 7117, 7125, 7129, 7136, 7139, 7144, 7148, 7153, 7157, 7162, 7165, 7167, 7168, 7172, 7174, 7175, 7182, 7184, 7185, 7186, 7189, 7199, 7207, 7211, 7217, 7224, 7227, 7232, 7235, 7238, 7239, 7243, 7245, 7246, 7247, 7250, 7257, 7260, 7270, 7272]}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2126, "completion_tokens": 151, "total_tokens": 2277}, "metadata": 148, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\\hline& $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Fed only } \\\\ \\text { dry food }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Fed both wet } \\\\ \\text { and dry food }\\end{array}$ & Total \\\\\\hlineCats & 5 & 11 & 16 \\\\\\hlineDogs & 2 & 23 & 25 \\\\\\hlineTotal & 7 & 34 & 41 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The table above shows the kinds of foods that are fed to the cats and dogs currently boarded at a pet care facility.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)-\\left(-3 x^{2}+5\\right)$$Which of the following expressions is equivalent to the one above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$4 x^{2}-8$ (B)$4 x^{2}-2$ (C)$-2 x^{2}-8$ (D)$-2 x^{2}-2$\n", "line_idx": 149}

Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A certain package requires 3 centimeters of tape to be closed securely. What is the maximum number of packages of this type that can be secured with 6 meters of tape? $(1$ meter $=100 \\mathrm{~cm})$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)100 (B)150 (C)200 (D)300\n", "line_idx": 150}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ satisfies the inequality $5 x-3 y<4$ ?I. $(1,1)$II. $(2,5)$III. $(3,2)$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)I only (B)II only (C)I and II only (D)I and III only\n", "line_idx": 152}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Substituting $x=-3$ into the equation yields $(a(-3)+3)^{2}=36$. Simplifying this equation yields $a^{2}-6 a+9=36$. Since the left side of the equation is a perfect square, the equation can be rewritten as $(a-3)^{2}=27$. Solving this equation yields $a-3=\\pm \\sqrt{27}$, or $a=3 \\pm \\sqrt{27}$. Since $a$ is a constant, it must be the same for both solutions. Therefore, $a=3+\\sqrt{27}=3+3 \\sqrt{3} \\approx 11.7$. Since $a$ is a constant, it must be an integer. The closest integer to 11.7 is 11, which is not one of the choices. The next closest integer is 12, which is also not one of the choices. The next closest integer is 5, which is choice $\\mathrm{B}$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because they are not solutions to the equation.\nThe answer is therefore B", "index": 0, "logprobs":

265, "total_tokens": 2241}, "metadata": 153, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In the equation $(a x+3)^{2}=36, a$ is a constant. If $x=-3$ is one solution to the equation, what is a possible value of $a$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-11 (B)-5 (C)-1 (D)0\n", "line_idx": 153}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$9 a x+9 b-6=21$$Based on the equation above, what is the value of $a x+b ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)3 (B)6 (C)8 (D)12\n", "line_idx": 154}

According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Lani spent $15 \\%$ of her 8-hour workday in meetings. How many minutes of her workday did she spend in meetings?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.2 (B)15 (C)48 (D)72\n", "line_idx": 155}

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis.

Thus, the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added is $\\$ 53.00-\\$ 53.00 \\times 0.06=\\$ 47.60$.Choices $B, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when calculating the amount of the sales tax or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore A", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem", " 6", ":", "  ", " Choice", " A", " is", " correct", ".", " The", " price", " of", " the", " jacket", " before", " the", " sales", " tax", " was", " added", " is", " the", " amount", " of", " money", " the", " customer", " paid", " minus", " the", " amount", " of", " the", " sales", " tax", ".", " The", " amount", " of", " the", " sales", " tax", " can", " be", " calculated", " by", " multiplying", " the", " price", " of", " the", " jacket", " by", " the", " sales", " tax", " rate", " of", " 6", " percent", ".", " Thus", ",", " the", " price", " of", " the", " jacket", " before", " the", " sales", " tax", " was", " added", " is", " $\\", "$", " 53", ".", "00", "-", "\\", "$", " 53", ".", "00", " \\", "times", " 0", ".", "06", "=", "\\", "$", " 47", ".", "60", "$.", "Cho", "ices", " $", "B", ",", " C", "$,", " and", " $", "D", "$", " are", " incorrect", " and", " may", " result", " from", " errors", " made", " when", " calculating", " the", " amount", " of", " the", " sales", " tax", " or", " other", " computational", " errors", ".", "\n", "The", " answer", " is", " therefore", " A", "<|endoftext|>", " §§", " FILE"], "token_logprobs": [-2.665838e-05, -0.0026204516, -2.0098154e-05, -4.721163e-06, -0.00030845366, -0.00032777296, -0.0002078772, -0.0023157755, -0.03562209, -0.0014616939, -0.8117571, -0.00033629782, -0.00064657355, -0.00047088155, -0.8511327, -0.96813685, -0.14341646, -0.016415035, -0.0040484546, -0.040872324, -0.048383735, -0.05563251, -0.00013109177, -0.035403706, -0.033174764, -0.7042039, -1.181288, -0.9368678, -0.80382264, -0.6700984, -1.0611583, -0.00050111365, -0.3104801, -0.97802746, -0.010924749, -0.21102999, -0.0074717905, -0.7258607, -0.13482864, -0.00013657632, -0.115302786, -1.0841029, -0.43715551, -0.07951536, -0.2498347, -0.0082827965, -7.613187e-05, -0.70061004, -0.0003016569, -0.7051399, -0.658904, -0.118659995, -0.07560424, -0.23239058, -0.18874514, -0.0002983181, -0.009394668, -0.55924046, -0.26325136, -0.44892648, -0.00042067032, -0.009584875, -1.2625612, -0.10011396, -0.89804584, -1.0770804, -0.9669423, -0.00805793, -0.09219439, -0.46607533, -0.103193305, -0.00028901699, -0.00029724615, -0.012493335, -0.014090309, -0.023065817, -0.0001015252, -0.016946917, -0.008182676, -0.10633069, -0.2151791, -0.036584567, -0.23063272, -0.031297434, -0.0015356521, -0.4338491, -0.27067184, -0.4649095, -0.57073164, -0.014603059, -0.00043581732, -0.027647251, -0.022447396, -0.23192589, -0.00046288988, -0.0008751519, -0.031947054, -0.0045872238, -0.013691115, -0.15353276, -0.00051960035, -0.0039795125, -0.17841768, -0.4789866, -1.6282536e-05, -0.35424918, -0.001987001, -0.1467865, -0.020708388, -0.20116317, -0.0003525167, -0.036130987, -0.00046706502, -0.00017282138, -0.005836362, -0.0030319951, -0.20722772, -0.012831011, -0.019000944, -0.00035860104, -0.360439, -0.21311913, -0.147189, -0.63172317, -0.019922612, -0.32413903, -0.0025878816, -0.04052976, -0.005157375, -9.127325e-05, -0.649465, -0.68230474, -0.06254164, -0.0022018477, -0.0017797218, -0.030091006, -0.0012562544, -0.00012417485, -0.00012143587, -0.0016464569, -0.00028317483, -0.013413312, -0.012941503, -0.0005210318], "top_logprobs": null, "text_offset": [6300, 6300, 6302, 6306, 6311, 6315, 6323, 6325, 6326, 6328, 6335, 6337, 6340, 6348, 6349, 6353, 6359, 6362, 6366, 6373, 6380, 6384, 6390, 6394, 6398, 6404, 6407, 6411, 6418, 6421, 6427, 6431, 6440, 6445, 6451, 6455, 6462, 6465, 6469, 6475, 6479, 6480, 6484, 6491, 6494, 6498, 6504, 6508, 6512, 6515, 6526, 6529, 6541, 6545, 6551, 6554, 6558, 6565, 6568, 6572, 6578, 6582, 6587, 6590, 6592, 6600, 6601, 6606, 6607, 6611, 6617, 6620, 6624, 6631, 6638, 6642, 6648, 6652, 6656, 6662, 6665, 6668, 6669, 6672, 6673, 6675, 6676, 6677, 6678, 6681, 6682, 6684, 6686, 6691, 6693, 6694, 6696, 6697, 6698, 6699, 6702, 6703, 6705, 6707, 6710, 6714, 6716, 6717, 6718, 6720, 6722, 6726, 6728, 6729, 6730, 6734, 6744, 6748, 6752, 6759, 6764, 6771, 6776, 6781, 6793, 6797, 6804, 6807, 6811, 6817, 6821, 6824, 6830, 6844, 6851, 6852, 6853, 6856, 6863, 6866, 6876, 6878, 6878, 6878]}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1991, "completion_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 2132}, "metadata": 157, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A customer paid $\\$ 53.00$ for a jacket after a 6 percent sales tax was added. What was the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\$ 47.60$ (B)$\\$ 50.00$ (C)$\\$ 52.60$ (D)$\\$ 52.84$\n", "line_idx": 157}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If 50 one-cent coins were stacked on top of each other in a column, the column would be approximately $3 \\frac{7}{8}$ inches tall. At this rate, which of the following is closest to the number of one-cent coins it would take to make an 8-inch-tall column?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)75 (B)100 (C)200 (D)390\n", "line_idx": 158}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $a-b=12$ and $\\frac{b}{2}=10$, what is the value of $a+b ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)2 (B)12 (C)32 (D)52\n", "line_idx": 159}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$y=19.99+1.50 x$$The equation above models the total cost $y$, in dollars, that a company charges a customer to rent a truck for one day and drive the truck $x$ miles. The total cost consists of a flat fee plus a charge per mile driven. When the equation is graphed in the $x y$-plane, what does the $y$-intercept of the graph represent in terms of the model?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A flat fee of $\\$ 19.99$ (B)A charge per mile of $\\$ 1.50$ (C)A charge per mile of $\\$ 19.99$ (D)Total daily charges of $\\$ 21.49$\n", "line_idx": 160}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   $$.\\begin{aligned}.& \\text { Mosteller's formula: } A=\\frac{\\sqrt{h w}}{60} \\\\.& \\text { Current's formula: } A=\\frac{4+w}{30}.\\end{aligned}.$$.The formulas above are used in medicine to estimate the body surface area $A$, in square meters, of infants and children whose weight $w$ ranges between 3 and 30 kilograms and whose height $h$ is measured in centimeters.

In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   $$.\\begin{aligned}.& \\text { Mosteller's formula: } A=\\frac{\\sqrt{h w}}{60} \\\\.& \\text { Current's formula: } A=\\frac{4+w}{30}.\\end{aligned}.$$.The formulas above are used in medicine to estimate the body surface area $A$, in square meters, of infants and children whose weight $w$ ranges between 3 and 30 kilograms and whose height $h$ is measured in centimeters. If Mosteller's and Current's formulas give the same estimate for $A$, which of the following expressions is equivalent to $\\sqrt{h w}$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{4+w}{2}$ (B)$\\frac{4+w}{1,800}$ (C)$2(4+w)$ (D)$\\frac{(4+w)^{2}}{2}$\n", "line_idx": 162}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

"completion_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 2306}, "metadata": 164, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \\mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$7.5 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (B)$185 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (C)$640 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (D)$750 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$\n", "line_idx": 164}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice A is correct. The number 72 in the given function represents the initial height of the object, in feet. This can be seen by noting that when $t=0$, the function evaluates to $h(0)=72$.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$h(t)=-16 t^{2}+110 t+72$$The function above models the height $h$, in feet, of an object above ground $t$ seconds after being launched straight up in the air. What does the number 72 represent in the function?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The initial height, in feet, of the object (B)The maximum height, in feet, of the object (C)The initial speed, in feet per second, of the object (D)The maximum speed, in feet per second, of the object\n", "line_idx": 165}

"completion_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 2319}, "metadata": 166, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\\begin{center}.\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\\\.\\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\\\.\\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\\\.\\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\\\.\\hline.\\end{tabular}.\\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food. If $x$ food calories is equivalent to $k$ kilojoules, of the following, which best represents the relationship between $x$ and $k$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$k=0.24 x$ (B)$k=4.2 x$ (C)$x=4.2 k$ (D)$x k=4.2$\n", "line_idx": 166}

Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The world's population has grown at an average rate of 1.9 percent per year since 1945. There were approximately 4 billion people in the world in 1975. Which of the following functions represents the world's population $P$, in billions of people, $t$ years since $1975 ?(1$ billion $=1,000,000,000)$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$P(t)=4(1.019)^{t}$ (B)$P(t)=4(1.9)^{t}$ (C)$P(t)=1.19 t+4$ (D)$P(t)=1.019 t+4$\n", "line_idx": 168}

The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(-3,1)$. The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{25}=5$. Therefore, the circle is centered at $(-3,1)$ and has radius 5. The point $(-3,1)$ is the center of the circle and thus does not lie in the interior of the circle.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because these points lie in the interior of the circle.\nThe

{"prompt_tokens": 2003, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 2183}, "metadata": 169, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A circle in the $x y$-plane has equation$(x+3)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=25$. Which of the following points does NOT lie in the interior of the circle?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(-7,3)$ (B)$(-3,1)$ (C)$(0,0)$ (D)$(3,2)$\n", "line_idx": 169}

problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    \\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Subscriptions } \\\\ \\text { sold }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\\\2013 & 5,880 \\\\\\end{tabular}\\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service.

$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$3 x+x+x+x-3-2=7+x+x$$In the equation above, what is the value of $x$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$-\\frac{5}{7}$ (B)1 (C)$\\frac{12}{7}$ (D)3\n", "line_idx": 171}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The formula below is often used by project managers to compute $E$, the estimated time to complete a job, where $O$ is the shortest completion time, $P$ is the longest completion time, and $M$ is the most likely completion time.$$E=\\frac{O+4 M+P}{6}$$Which of the following correctly gives $P$ in terms of $E, O$, and $M$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$P=6 E-O-4 M$ (B)$P=-6 E+O+4 M$ (C)$P=\\frac{O+4 M+E}{6}$ (D)$P=\\frac{O+4 M-E}{6}$\n", "line_idx": 172}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The width of a rectangular dance floor is $w$ feet. The length of the floor is 6 feet longer than its width. Which of the following expresses the perimeter, in feet, of the dance floor in terms of $w$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$2 w+6$ (B)$4 w+12$ (C)$w^{2}+6$ (D)$w^{2}+6 w$\n", "line_idx": 173}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{B}$ is correct. The given system of inequalities can be rewritten as $y>2 x-1$ and $y<2 x-5$. Since the two inequalities are both true for the same values of $x$ and $y$, the solution set of the system is the intersection of the two inequalities. The intersection of the two inequalities is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $2 x-5<y<2 x-1$. Since $2 x-5<2 x-1$, it follows that $y>2 x-5$. Therefore, the $y$-coordinates of all the points that satisfy the system of inequalities are greater than $2 x-5$. Since $2 x-5$ is equivalent to $4$ when $x=2.5$, the $y$-coordinates of all the points that satisfy the system of inequalities are greater than $4$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because these

answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}y & >2 x-1 \\\\2 x & >5\\end{aligned}$$Which of the following consists of the $y$-coordinates of all the points that satisfy the system of inequalities above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$y>6$ (B)$y>4$ (C)$y>\\frac{5}{2}$ (D)$y>\\frac{3}{2}$\n", "line_idx": 174}

$$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\sqrt{2 x+6}+4=x+3$$What is the solution set of the equation above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\{-1\\}$ (B)$\\{5\\}$ (C)$\\{-1,5\\}$ (D)$\\{0,-1,5\\}$\n", "line_idx": 175}

exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& f(x)=x^{3}-9 x \\\\& g(x)=x^{2}-2 x-3\\end{aligned}$$Which of the following expressions is equivalent to$\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, for $x>3 ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{1}{x+1}$ (B)$\\frac{x+3}{x+1}$ (C)$\\frac{x(x-3)}{x+1}$ (D)$\\frac{x(x+3)}{x+1}$\n", "line_idx": 176}

Since the group of 202 people took 60 tents with them, the total number of people that can be accommodated in the tents is $60 \\times 6=360$. Since each 2-person tent can accommodate 2 people and each 4-person tent can accommodate 4 people, the total number of people that can be accommodated in the 2-person tents is $2 \\times x$, where $x$ is the number of 2-person tents. The total number of people that can be accommodated in the 4-person tents is $4 \\times(60-x)$. Since the total number of people that can be accommodated in the tents is 360, the following equation must be true: $2x+4(60-x)=360$. Solving this equation for $x$ yields $x=30$.

problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A group of 202 people went on an overnight camping trip, taking 60 tents with them. Some of the tents held 2 people each, and the rest held 4 people each. Assuming all the tents were filled to capacity and every person got to sleep in a tent, exactly how many of the tents were 2-person tents?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)30 (B)20 (C)19 (D)18 11\n", "line_idx": 177}

The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.

Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $\\frac{2 a}{b}=\\frac{1}{2}$, what is the value of $\\frac{b}{a} ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{1}{8}$ (B)$\\frac{1}{4}$ (C)2 (D)4\n", "line_idx": 178}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. The given information can be used to find the slope of the line that models the production. The slope of a line is equal to the change in the $y$-values divided by the change in the $x$-values. Since the production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, the change in the $y$-values is $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels. The change in the $x$-values is $2013-2000=13$ years. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\\frac{2.1}{13}=\\frac{19}{130}$. The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Since the production in 2000 was 4 million barrels, the $y$-intercept is 4. Therefore, the equation of the line that models the production is $f(t)=-\\frac{19}{130} t+4$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these equations do not have the correct slope.\nThe answer

If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$f(t)=\\frac{21}{130} t+4$ (B)$f(t)=\\frac{19}{130} t+4$ (C)$f(t)=-\\frac{21}{130} t+4$ (D)$f(t)=-\\frac{19}{130} t+4$\n", "line_idx": 179}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.

In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& y=x^{2}+3 x-7 \\\\& y-5 x+8=0\\end{aligned}$$How many solutions are there to the system of equations above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)There are exactly 4 solutions. (B)There are exactly 2 solutions. (C)There is exactly 1 solution. (D)There are no solutions.\n", "line_idx": 180}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& g(x)=2 x-1 \\\\& h(x)=1-g(x)\\end{aligned}$$The functions $g$ and $h$ are defined above.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    One pound of grapes costs $\\$ 2$. At this rate, how many dollars will $c$ pounds of grapes cost?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$2 c$ (B)$2+c$ (C)$\\frac{2}{c}$ (D)$\\frac{c}{2}$\n", "line_idx": 182}

$x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In a random sample of 200 cars of a particular model, 3 have a manufacturing defect. At this rate, how many of 10,000 cars of the same model will have a manufacturing defect?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)150 (B)200 (C)250 (D)300\n", "line_idx": 183}

Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Which of the following systems of equations could be used to find the number of tickets for bench seats, $B$, and the number of tickets for lawn seats, $L$, that were sold for the concert?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(75 B)(40 L)=1,950$ $B+L=350$ (B)$40 B+75 L=19,250$ $B+L=350$ (C)$75 B+40 L=350$ $B+L=19,250$ (D)$75 B+40 L=19,250$ $B+L=350$\n", "line_idx": 184}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.

Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros.

The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$x+1=\\frac{2}{x+1}$$In the equation above, which of the following is a possible value of $x+1$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$1-\\sqrt{2}$ (B)$\\sqrt{2}$ (C)2 (D)4\n", "line_idx": 186}

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Which of the following systems of inequalities describes $x$, the possible number of $\\$ 50,000$ policies, and $y$, the possible number of $\\$ 100,000$ policies, that Roberto sold last month?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$x+y<57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y<3,000,000$ (B)$x+y>57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y>3,000,000$ (C)$x+y<57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y>3,000,000$ (D)$x+y>57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y<3,000,000$\n", "line_idx": 187}

The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$.

Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\begin{aligned}& 2 x-y=8 \\\\& x+2 y=4\\end{aligned}$$For the system of equations above, what is the value of $x+y$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-1 (B)4 (C)5 (D)20\n", "line_idx": 188}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

2176}, "metadata": 190, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Which of the following statements is true about the graph of the equation $2 y-3 x=-4$ in the $x y$-plane?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)It has a negative slope and a positive $y$-intercept. (B)It has a negative slope and a negative $y$-intercept. (C)It has a positive slope and a positive $y$-intercept. (D)It has a positive slope and a negative $y$-intercept.\n", "line_idx": 190}

the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The front of a roller-coaster car is at the bottom of a hill and is 15 feet above the ground. If the front of the roller-coaster car rises at a constant rate of 8 feet per second, which of the following equations gives the height $h$, in feet, of the front of the roller-coaster car $s$ seconds after it starts up the hill?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$h=8 s+15$ (B)$h=15 s+\\frac{335}{8}$ (C)$h=8 s+\\frac{335}{15}$ (D)$h=15 s+8$\n", "line_idx": 191}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice C is correct. Let $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ represent the number of hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job, respectively. Since the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, it follows that $h_{1}=h_{2}+2$. Substituting this into the given equation yields $C_{1}=75(h_{2}+2)+125$ and $C_{2}=75 h_{2}+125$, where $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are the amounts the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland, respectively. Subtracting $C_{2}$ from $C_{1}$ yields $C_{1}-C_{2}=75(h_{2}+2)-75 h_{2}=150$. Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $150$ dollars more than Mr. Roland.Choices $A$ and $B$ are incorrect because these choices are too small.

"usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2032, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 2289}, "metadata": 192, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\$ 75$ (B)$\\$ 125$ (C)$\\$ 150$ (D)$\\$ 275$\n", "line_idx": 192}

Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$2 a x-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. If no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, what is the value of $a$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1 (B)2 (C)4 (D)8\n", "line_idx": 194}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$(a x+3)\\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$The equation above is true for all $x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. What is the value of $a b$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)18 (B)20 (C)24 (D)40\n", "line_idx": 195}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\frac{x}{x-3}=\\frac{2 x}{2}$$Which of the following represents all the possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0 and 2 (B)0 and 4 (C)-4 and 4 (D)4\n", "line_idx": 196}

Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\frac{1}{2 x+1}+5$$Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above for $x>0$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{2 x+5}{2 x+1}$ (B)$\\frac{2 x+6}{2 x+1}$ (C)$\\frac{10 x+5}{2 x+1}$ (D)$\\frac{10 x+6}{2 x+1}$\n", "line_idx": 197}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    What is the set of all solutions to the equation $\\sqrt{x+2}=-x ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\{-1,2\\}$ (B)$\\{-1\\}$ (C)$\\{2\\}$ (D)There are no solutions to the given equation.\n", "line_idx": 198}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.

For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$\\sqrt{x^{2}}=x$$Which of the following values of $x$ is NOT a solution to the equation above?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-4 (B)0 (C)1 (D)3\n", "line_idx": 201}

"context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Washington High School randomly selected freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior students for a survey about potential changes to next year's schedule. Of students selected for the survey, $\\frac{1}{4}$ were freshmen and $\\frac{1}{3}$ were sophomores. Half of the remaining selected students were juniors. If336 students were selected for the survey, how many were seniors?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)240 (B)140 (C)120 (D)70\n", "line_idx": 202}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Plant A is currently 20 centimeters tall, and Plant B is currently 12 centimeters tall. The ratio of the heights of Plant A to Plant B is equal to the ratio of the heights of Plant $\\mathrm{C}$ to Plant D. If Plant $\\mathrm{C}$ is 54 centimeters tall, what is the height of Plant $\\mathrm{D}$, in centimeters?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)32.4 (B)44.0 (C)62.0 (D)90.0\n", "line_idx": 203}

Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Biologists found a new species of pale shrimp at the world's deepest undersea vent, the Beebe Vent Field. The vent is 3.1 miles below the sea's surface.Approximately how many kilometers below the sea's surface is the vent?

graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)2 (B)4 (C)5 (D)6\n", "line_idx": 205}

( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    A company purchased a machine valued at $\\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \\leq t \\leq 10 ?$\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$v=30,000-9,000 t$ (B)$v=120,000-9,000 t$ (C)$v=120,000+9,000 t$ (D)$v=120,000-30,000 t$\n", "line_idx": 206}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. The equation of a line in the $x y$-plane can be written in the form $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find the equation of line $m$, we can first calculate the slope of the line. The slope of a line is given by the formula $\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$, where $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ are two points on the line. Using the given points, the slope of line $m$ is $\\frac{1-4}{0-2}=-\\frac{3}{2}$. The $y$-intercept of line $m$ can be found by substituting the coordinates of one of the given points into the equation of the line. For example, substituting $(2,4)$ into the equation $y=mx+b$ yields $4=-\\frac{3}{2}(2)+b$, or $b=7$. Therefore, the equation of line $m$ is $y=-\\frac{3}{2} x+7$. Rewriting this equation in the form $y=\\frac{3}{2} x+b$ yields $y=\\frac{3}{2} x+1$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these equations do not represent the line with the given points.\nFor example, if the equation of line $m$ were $y=2 x+3$, then the point $(2,4)$ would not lie on the line.\nThe answer is therefore D", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", "

are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Line $m$ in the $x y$-plane contains the points $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$. Which of the following is an equation of line $m$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$y=2 x+3$ (B)$y=2 x+4$ (C)$y=\\frac{3}{2} x+3$ (D)$y=\\frac{3}{2} x+1$\n", "line_idx": 207}

Comparing coefficients of $x$ on both sides of the equation yields $3 a-8=b$. Solving for $b$ yields $b=3 a-8$. Since $a$ is a constant, $b$ is also a constant.

"metadata": 208, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$(4 x+4)(a x-1)-x^{2}+4$$In the expression above, $a$ is a constant. If the expression is equivalent to $b x$, where $b$ is a constant, what is the value of $b$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-5 (B)-3 (C)0 (D)12\n", "line_idx": 208}

"finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1965, "completion_tokens": 443, "total_tokens": 2408}, "metadata": 209, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.

{"prompt_tokens": 2084, "completion_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 2273}, "metadata": 210, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \\%$ of the daily allowance for adults. If $p$ percent of an adult's daily allowance of potassium is provided by $x$ servings of Crunchy Grain cereal per day, which of the following expresses $p$ in terms of $x$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$p=0.5 x$ (B)$p=5 x$ (C)$p=(0.05)^{x}$ (D)$p=(1.05)^{x}$\n", "line_idx": 210}

answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.   Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \\%$ of the daily allowance for adults. On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{1}{8} \\operatorname{cup}$ (B)$\\frac{1}{4} \\operatorname{cup}$ (C)$\\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{cup}$ (D)$\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{cup}$\n", "line_idx": 211}

The graph of the exponential function $h$ has a $y$-intercept of $d$, which means that the point $(0, d)$ lies on the graph. This implies that $h(0)=d$. Therefore, the function $h$ must be of the form $h(x)=d(b)^{x}$, where $b$ is a constant. Since $h(0)=d$, it follows that $d(b)^{0}=d$, or $b=1$.

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The graph of the exponential function $h$ in the $x y$-plane, where $y=h(x)$, has a $y$-intercept of $d$, where $d$ is a positive constant. Which of the following could define the function $h$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$h(x)=-3(d)^{x}$ (B)$h(x)=3(x) d$ (C)$h(x)=d(-x)^{3}$ (D)$h(x)=d(3)^{x}$\n", "line_idx": 212}

Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    The weights, in pounds, for 15 horses in a stable were reported, and the mean, median, range, and standard deviation for the data were found. The horse with the lowest reported weight was found to actually weigh 10 pounds less than its reported weight. What value remains unchanged if the four values are reported using the corrected weight?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)Mean (B)Median (C)Range (D)Standard deviation\n", "line_idx": 213}

problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    Near the end of a US cable news show, the host invited viewers to respond to a poll on the show's website that asked, \"Do you support the new federal policy discussed during the show?\" At the end of the show, the host reported that $28 \\%$ responded \"Yes,\" and $70 \\%$ responded \"No.\" Which of the following best explains why the results are unlikely to represent the sentiments of the population of the United States?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The percentages do not add up to $100 \\%$, so any possible conclusions from the poll are invalid. (B)Those who responded to the poll were not a random sample of the population of the United States. (C)There were not $50 \\%$ \"Yes\" responses and $50 \\%$ \"No\" responses. (D)The show did not allow viewers enough time to respond to the poll.\n", "line_idx": 214}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. Since $f(x+a)=5 x^{2}+30 x+42$, substituting $x=0$ yields $f(a)=42$. Since $f(x)=5 x^{2}-3$, substituting $x=0$ yields $f(0)=-3$. Therefore, $f(a)-f(0)=42-(-3)=45$. Since $f(x)=5 x^{2}-3$, it follows that $f(x+a)-f(x)=5(x+a)^{2}-3-5 x^{2}+3=5(x+a)^{2}-5 x^{2}=5(x^{2}+2 a x+a^{2})$. Therefore, $45=5(0^{2}+2 a \\times 0+a^{2})=5 a^{2}$, so $a^{2}=9$ and $a=\\pm 3$. Since $a$ is the amount by which $x$ is increased, $a$ must be positive, so $a=3$.Choices $A$ and $B$ are incorrect because they are the negative of the correct answer. Choice $C$ is incorrect because it is half of the correct answer.\nThe answer is therefore D", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem", " 6", ":", "  ", "

According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $f(x)=5 x^{2}-3$ and $f(x+a)=5 x^{2}+30 x+42$, what is the value of $a$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)-30 (B)$\\quad-3$ (C)3 (D)30\n", "line_idx": 215}

The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$.

If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis.

"completion_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 2229}, "metadata": 217, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    $$h(x)=-16 x^{2}+100 x+10$$The quadratic function above models the height above the ground $h$, in feet, of a projectile $x$ seconds after it had been launched vertically. If $y=h(x)$ is graphed in the $x y$-plane, which of the following represents the real-life meaning of the positive $x$-intercept of the graph?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)The initial height of the projectile (B)The maximum height of the projectile (C)The time at which the projectile reaches its maximum height (D)The time at which the projectile hits the ground\n", "line_idx": 217}
{"choices": [{"text": "Explanation for Problem 6:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Since the graph of $f$ crosses the $x$-axis at two points, $(a, 0)$ and $(b, 0)$, where $a$ and $b$ are both positive, it follows that $f(a)=f(b)=0$. Therefore, $f$ must be a polynomial of degree 2 with zeros at $x=a$ and $x=b$. The only choice that satisfies this condition is $f(x)=(x-a)(x+b)$.Choices $A$ and $B$ are incorrect because these choices have zeros at $x=-a$ and $x=-b$, respectively, which are not the zeros of $f$. Choice $D$ is incorrect because this choice is a polynomial of degree 3, not degree 2.\nThe answer is therefore C", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", " for", " Problem",

   $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the polynomial function $f$ crosses the $x$-axis at exactly two points, $(a, 0)$ and $(b, 0)$, where $a$ and $b$ are both positive. Which of the following could define $f$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$f(x)=(x-a)(x-b)$ (B)$f(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$ (C)$f(x)=(x-a)(x+b)$ (D)$f(x)=x(x-a)(x-b)$\n", "line_idx": 218}

"metadata": 219, "context": "Here are the answers for the problems in the exam.\nProblem 1.    $$(x-6)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the equation above is a circle. Point $P$ is on the circle and has coordinates $(10,-5)$. If $\\overline{P Q}$ is a diameter of the circle, what are the coordinates of point $Q$ ?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$(2,-5)$ (B)$(6,-1)$ (C)$(6,-5)$ (D)$(6,-9)$\nExplanation for Problem 1:   Choice $A$ is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center and $r$ is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is $(6,-5)$. Let $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ represent the coordinates of point $Q$. Since point $P(10,-5)$ and point $Q\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center $(6,-5)$ lies on the diameter, halfway between $P$ and $Q$. Therefore, the following relationships hold: $\\frac{x_{1}+10}{2}=6$ and $\\frac{y_{1}+(-5)}{2}=-5$. Solving the equations for $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$, respectively, yields $x_{1}=2$ and $y_{1}=-5$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $Q$ are $(2,-5)$.Alternate approach: Since point $P(10,-5)$ on the circle and the center of the circle $(6,-5)$ have the same $y$-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is $10-6=4$. In addition, the opposite end of the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$ must have the same $y$-coordinate as $P$ and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point $Q$ must be $(2,-5)$.Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter $\\overline{P Q}$. If either of these points were point $Q$, then $\\overline{P Q}$ would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice $C$ is incorrect because $(6,-5)$ is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.\nThe answer is therefore A\nProblem 2.    Two units of length used in ancient Egypt were cubits and palms, where 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms. The Great Sphinx statue in Giza is approximately 140 cubits long. Which of the following best approximates the length, in palms, of the Great Sphinx statue?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)0.05 (B)20 (C)140 (D)980\nExplanation for Problem 2:   Choice D is correct. Since 1 cubit is equivalent to 7 palms, 140 cubits are equivalent to 140 (7) palms, or 980 palms.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 7 by 140. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from dividing 140 by 7 . Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. This is the length of the Great Sphinx statue in cubits, not palms.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 3.    In the 1908 Olympic Games, the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers to approximately 42 kilometers. Of the following, which is closest to the increase in the distance of the Olympic marathon, in miles? ( 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers.)\nChoose from the following options:    (A)1.00 (B)1.25 (C)1.50 (D)1.75\nExplanation for Problem 3:   Choice B is correct. In 1908, the marathon was lengthened by $42-40=2$ kilometers. Since 1 mile is approximately 1.6 kilometers, the increase of 2 kilometers can be converted to miles by multiplying as shown: 2 kilometers $\\times \\frac{1 \\text { mile }}{1.6 \\text { kilometers }}=1.25$ miles .Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect and may result from errors made when applying the conversion rate or other computational errors.\nThe answer is therefore B\nProblem 4.    The expression $\\frac{x^{-2} y^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{x^{\\frac{1}{3}} y^{-1}}$, where $x>1$ and $y>1$, is equivalent to which of the following?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$\\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (B)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}$ (C)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x \\sqrt{x}}$ (D)$\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$\nExplanation for Problem 4:   Choice $\\mathbf{D}$ is correct. For $x>1$ and $y>1, x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ and $y^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ are equivalent to $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ and $\\sqrt{y}$, respectively. Also, $x^{-2}$ and $y^{-1}$ are equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ and $\\frac{1}{y}$, respectively. Using these equivalences, the given expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{y \\sqrt{y}}{x^{2} \\sqrt[3]{x}}$.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect because these choices are not equivalent to the given expression for $x>1$ and $y>1$.For example, for $x=2$ and $y=2$, the value of the given expression is $2^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$; the values of the choices, however, are $2^{-\\frac{1}{3}}, 2^{\\frac{5}{6}}$, and 1, respectively.\nThe answer is therefore D\nProblem 5.    Which of the following is an example of a function whose graph in the $x y$-plane has no $x$-intercepts?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)A linear function whose rate of change is not zero (B)A quadratic function with real zeros (C)A quadratic function with no real zeros (D)A cubic polynomial with at least one real zero\nExplanation for Problem 5:   Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. If $f$ is a function of $x$, then the graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane consists of all points $(x, f(x))$. An $x$-intercept is where the graph intersects the $x$-axis; since all points on the $x$-axis have $y$-coordinate 0 , the graph of $f$ will cross the $x$-axis at values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Therefore, the graph of a function $f$ will have no $x$-intercepts if and only if $f$ has no real zeros. Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no $x$-intercepts.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the $x y$-plane whose rate of change is not zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The $x$-axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0 , so the graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the $x$-axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the $x$-axis at some point, and this point is an $x$-intercept of the graph. Choices $B$ and $D$ are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero must have an $x$-intercept.\nThe answer is therefore C\nProblem 6.    If $y=3 x^{2}+6 x+2$ is graphed in the $x y$-plane, which of the following characteristics of the graph is displayed as a constant or coefficient in the equation?\nChoose from the following options:    (A)$y$-coordinate of the vertex (B)$x$-intercept $(\\mathrm{s})$ (C)$y$-intercept (D)$x$-intercept of the line of symmetry\n", "line_idx": 219}
